	abstract = {Quantitative imaging biomarkers (QIBs) are increasingly used in clinical studies. Because many QIBs are derived through multiple steps in image data acquisition and data analysis, QIB measurements can produce large variabilities, posing a significant challenge in translating QIBs into clinical trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Both repeatability and reproducibility constitute the reliability of a QIB measurement. In this article, we review the statistical aspects of repeatability and reproducibility of QIB measurements by introducing methods and metrics for assessments of QIB repeatability and reproducibility and illustrating the impact of QIB measurement error on sample size and statistical power calculations, as well as predictive performance with a QIB as a predictive biomarker.},

@article{Minasian:2023wl,
	abstract = {Blood-based assays using various technologies and biomarkers are in commercial development for the purpose of detecting multiple cancer types concurrently at an early stage of disease. These multicancer early detection (MCED) assays have the potential to improve the detection of cancers, particularly those for which no current screening modality exists. However, the unknown clinical benefits and harms of using MCED assays for cancer screening necessitate the development and implementation of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to ascertain their clinical effectiveness. This was the consensus of experts at a National Cancer Institute-hosted workshop to discuss initial design concepts for such a trial. Using these assays to screen simultaneously for multiple cancers poses novel uncertainties for patient care compared with conventional screening tests for single cancers, such as establishing the diagnostic workup to confirm the presence of cancer at any organ site; clarifying appropriate follow-up for a positive assay for which there is no definitive diagnosis; identifying potential harms such as overdiagnosis of indolent disease; determining clinically effective and efficient strategies for disseminating MCED screening in real-world practice; and understanding the ethical implications, such as potentially alleviating or exacerbating existing health disparities. These assays present new and complex challenges for designing an RCT. Issues that emerged from the meeting centered around the need for a flexibly designed, clinical utility RCT to rigorously capture the evidence required to fully understand the net benefit of this promising technology. Specific topic areas were endpoints, screening protocols, recruitment, diagnostic pathway, pilot phase, data elements, specimen collection, and ethical considerations.},

	n2 = {Biological data are often intrinsically hierarchical. Due to their ability to account for such dependencies, mixed-effects models have become a common analysis technique in ecology and evolution. While many questions around their theoretical foundations and practical applications are solved, one fundamental question is still highly debated: When having a low number of levels should we model a grouping variable as a random or fixed effect? In such situation, the variance of the random effect is presumably underestimated, but whether this affects the statistical properties of the ecological effects (fixed effects) is unclear.Here, we analyzed the consequences of including a grouping variable as fixed or random effect and possible other modeling options (too simple or too complex models) for data with small number of levels in the grouping variable (2 - 8). For all models, we calculated type I error rates, power and coverage. Moreover, we show how these statistical properties change with the study design.We found that mixed-effects models already correctly estimate the variance of a random effect with only two groups. Moreover, model choice does not influence the statistical properties of the ecological effect when there is no random slope in the data-generating process. However, if an ecological effect differs among groups, using a random slope and intercept model, and switching to a fixed-effect model only in case of a singular fit, avoids overconfidence in the results. Additionally, power and type I error are strongly influenced by the number of and difference between groups.We conclude that inferring the correct random effect structure is of high importance to get correct statistical properties. When in doubt, we recommend starting with the simpler model and using model diagnostics to identify missing components. When having identified the correct structure, we encourage to start with a mixed-effects model independent of the number of groups and switch to a fixed-effect model only in case of a singular fit. With these recommendations, we allow for more informative choices about study design and data analysis and thus make ecological inference with mixed-effects models more robust for small number of groups.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {How should ecologists and evolutionary biologists analyze nonnormal data that involve random effects? Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize `best-practice'data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

Such tests can, however, be very poor for small and moderate sample sizes. The pbkrtest package implements two alternatives to such approximate χ&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; tests: The package implements (1) a Kenward-Roger approximation for performing F tests for reduction of the mean structure and (2) parametric bootstrap methods for achieving the same goal.

In addition to describing the methods and aspects of their implementation, the paper also contains several examples and a comparison of the various methods.},

	abstract = {Researchers designing experiments in which a sample of participants responds to a sample of stimuli are faced with difficult questions about optimal study design. The conventional procedures of statistical power analysis fail to provide appropriate answers to these questions because they are based on statistical models in which stimuli are not assumed to be a source of random variation in the data, models that are inappropriate for experiments involving crossed random factors of participants and stimuli. In this article, we present new methods of power analysis for designs with crossed random factors, and we give detailed, practical guidance to psychology researchers planning experiments in which a sample of participants responds to a sample of stimuli. We extensively examine 5 commonly used experimental designs, describe how to estimate statistical power in each, and provide power analysis results based on a reasonable set of default parameter values. We then develop general conclusions and formulate rules of thumb concerning the optimal design of experiments in which a sample of participants responds to a sample of stimuli. We show that in crossed designs, statistical power typically does not approach unity as the number of participants goes to infinity but instead approaches a maximum attainable power value that is possibly small, depending on the stimulus sample. We also consider the statistical merits of designs involving multiple stimulus blocks. Finally, we provide a simple and flexible Web-based power application to aid researchers in planning studies with samples of stimuli.},

	n2 = {Summary Intra-class correlations (ICC) and repeatabilities (R) are fundamental statistics for quantifying the reproducibility of measurements and for understanding the structure of biological variation. Linear mixed effects models offer a versatile framework for estimating ICC and R. However, while point estimation and significance testing by likelihood ratio tests is straightforward, the quantification of uncertainty is not as easily achieved. A further complication arises when the analysis is conducted on data with non-Gaussian distributions because the separation of the mean and the variance is less clear-cut for non-Gaussian than for Gaussian models. Nonetheless, there are solutions to approximate repeatability for the most widely used families of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Here, we introduce the R package rptR for the estimation of ICC and R for Gaussian, binomial and Poisson-distributed data. Uncertainty in estimators is quantified by parametric bootstrapping and significance testing is implemented by likelihood ratio tests and through permutation of residuals. The package allows control for fixed effects and thus the estimation of adjusted repeatabilities (that remove fixed effect variance from the estimate) and enhanced agreement repeatabilities (that add fixed effect variance to the denominator). Furthermore, repeatability can be estimated from random-slope models. The package features convenient summary and plotting functions. Besides repeatabilities, the package also allows the quantification of coefficients of determination R2 as well as of raw variance components. We present an example analysis to demonstrate the core features and discuss some of the limitations of rptR.},

	n2 = {Abstract Linear mixed-effects models are powerful tools for analysing complex datasets with repeated or clustered observations, a common data structure in ecology and evolution. Mixed-effects models involve complex fitting procedures and make several assumptions, in particular about the distribution of residual and random effects. Violations of these assumptions are common in real datasets, yet it is not always clear how much these violations matter to accurate and unbiased estimation. Here we address the consequences of violations in distributional assumptions and the impact of missing random effect components on model estimates. In particular, we evaluate the effects of skewed, bimodal and heteroscedastic random effect and residual variances, of missing random effect terms and of correlated fixed effect predictors. We focus on bias and prediction error on estimates of fixed and random effects. Model estimates were usually robust to violations of assumptions, with the exception of slight upward biases in estimates of random effect variance if the generating distribution was bimodal but was modelled by Gaussian error distributions. Further, estimates for (random effect) components that violated distributional assumptions became less precise but remained unbiased. However, this particular problem did not affect other parameters of the model. The same pattern was found for strongly correlated fixed effects, which led to imprecise, but unbiased estimates, with uncertainty estimates reflecting imprecision. Unmodelled sources of random effect variance had predictable effects on variance component estimates. The pattern is best viewed as a cascade of hierarchical grouping factors. Variances trickle down the hierarchy such that missing higher-level random effect variances pool at lower levels and missing lower-level and crossed random effect variances manifest as residual variance. Overall, our results show remarkable robustness of mixed-effects models that should allow researchers to use mixed-effects models even if the distributional assumptions are objectively violated. However, this does not free researchers from careful evaluation of the model. Estimates that are based on data that show clear violations of key assumptions should be treated with caution because individual datasets might give highly imprecise estimates, even if they will be unbiased on average across datasets.},

	abstract = {Mixed-effects models are a powerful tool for modeling fixed and random effects simultaneously, but do not offer a feasible analytic solution for estimating the probability that a test correctly rejects the null hypothesis. Being able to estimate this probability, however, is critical for sample size planning, as power is closely linked to the reliability and replicability of empirical findings. A flexible and very intuitive alternative to analytic power solutions are simulation-based power analyses. Although various tools for conducting simulation-based power analyses for mixed-effects models are available, there is lack of guidance on how to appropriately use them. In this tutorial, we discuss how to estimate power for mixed-effects models in different use cases: first, how to use models that were fit on available (e.g. published) data to determine sample size; second, how to determine the number of stimuli required for sufficient power; and finally, how to conduct sample size planning without available data. Our examples cover both linear and generalized linear models and we provide code and resources for performing simulation-based power analyses on openly accessible data sets. The present work therefore helps researchers to navigate sound research design when using mixed-effects models, by summarizing resources, collating available knowledge, providing solutions and tools, and applying them to real-world problems in sample sizing planning when sophisticated analysis procedures like mixed-effects models are outlined as inferential procedures.},

With the use of an integrated approach called automated assay optimization developed in collaboration with Beckman Coulter (Fullerton, CA), the process of conducting these experiments has been greatly facilitated. This approach imports an experimental design from a commercial statistical package and converts it into robotic methods. The data from these experiments are fed back into the statistical package and analyzed, resulting in empirical models for determining optimum assay conditions.

	abstract = {The application of massively parallel sequencing (MPS) in forensic sciences enables high-resolution short tandem repeat (STR) genotyping for the characterization of biological evidence. While MPS supports multiplexing of a large number of forensic markers, the performance of an MPS-STR panel depends on good primer design and optimal PCR conditions. However, conventional strategies for multifactorial assay optimization are labor-intensive and do not necessarily allow the experimenter to identify optimum factor settings. Here we describe our new multiplex PCR assay, monSTR, which supports the simultaneous amplification of 21 forensic markers followed by targeted sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq. The selection of STR markers adapts on the expanded European Standard Set (ESS), including the highly polymorphic locus SE33, for compatibility with existing forensic DNA databases. Primer engineering involved bioinformatics tools to create a multiplex-compatible primer set. Primer quality was evaluated in silico and in vitro. We demonstrate the systematic optimization of multiplex PCR thermocycling conditions using Design of Experiments (DOE) methodology. The objective was to yield a specific, balanced, low-noise amplification of forensic targets. A central composite face design of experiments enabled an efficient simultaneous investigation of multiple critical process parameters and their interactions. Optimal multiplex PCR conditions were predicted using software-aided modelling based on DOE data. Verification experiments suggested a balanced, reproducible amplification of all markers with reduced formation of artefacts. Fully concordant STR profiles were obtained for the investigated reference samples even with challenging input DNA concentrations. We found that application of DOE principles enabled an experimentally practical and economically justifiable assay development and optimization, even beyond the field of forensic genetics.},

This rate of HTS has increased the visibility of bottlenecks, one of which is assay optimization. In many organizations, experimental methods are generated by therapeutic teams associated with specific targets and passed on to the HTS group. The resulting assays frequently need to be further optimized to withstand the rigors and time frames inherent in robotic handling. Issues such as protein aggregation, ligand instability, and cellular viability are common variables in the optimization process. The availability of robotics capable of performing rapid random access tasks has made it possible to design optimization experiments that would be either very difficult or impossible for a person to carry out. Our approach to reducing the assay optimization bottleneck has been to unify the highly specific fields of statistics, biochemistry, and robotics. The product of these endeavors is a process we have named automated assay optimization (AAO). This has enabled us to determine final optimized assay conditions, which are often a composite of variables that we would not have arrived at by examining each variable independently. We have applied this approach to both radioligand binding and enzymatic assays and have realized benefits in both time and performance that we would not have predicted a priori. The fully developed AAO process encompasses the ability to download information to a robot and have liquid handling methods automatically created. This evolution in smart robotics has proven to be an invaluable tool for maintaining high-quality data in the context of increasing HTS demands.},

	abstract = {Expression analysis using microarray technology implies a complex experimental procedure with a large number of parameters affecting the final result. We have demonstrated that optimization of such a complex protocol can be far better handled using design of experiments (DOE) than by working on a single parameter at a time. Based on the results of a screening design, we developed a spotting buffer composed of formamide, betaine and nitrocellulose. This buffer provides a 2‐fold increase in signal‐to‐background ratio compared to 3×SSC. Comparison to seven other buffers tested on 10 different substrates revealed it had the highest sensitivity. DNA dissolved in this buffer can be spotted on epoxysilane‐coated microscope slides at a density of up to 70 000 spots per slide. A second DOE approach characterized the RNA labeling process with regard to the concentration of fluorescent dyes, dNTPs and reverse transcriptase. Adjust ments of the concentrations of dNTPs, as well as reverse transcriptase, towards the optimum, produced an improvement in the performance of the labeling procedure by a factor of 3 (Cy3) and 10 (Cy5). These results demonstrate that the process of establishing a stable expression profiling protocol and its further optimization can be significantly shortened and improved by DOE.},

@article{Zhou:2019vy,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA methylation plays crucial roles in most eukaryotic organisms. Bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq) is a sequencing approach that provides quantitative cytosine methylation levels in genome-wide scope and single-base resolution. However, genomic variations such as insertions and deletions (indels) affect methylation calling, and the alignment of reads near/across indels becomes inaccurate in the presence of polymorphisms. Hence, the simultaneous detection of DNA methylation and indels is important for exploring the mechanisms of functional regulation in organisms. RESULTS: These problems motivated us to develop the algorithm BatMeth2, which can align BS reads with high accuracy while allowing for variable-length indels with respect to the reference genome. The results from simulated and real bisulfite DNA methylation data demonstrated that our proposed method increases alignment accuracy. Additionally, BatMeth2 can calculate the methylation levels of individual loci, genomic regions or functional regions such as genes/transposable elements. Additional programs were also developed to provide methylation data annotation, visualization, and differentially methylated cytosine/region (DMC/DMR) detection. The whole package provides new tools and will benefit bisulfite data analysis. CONCLUSION: BatMeth2 improves DNA methylation calling, particularly for regions close to indels. It is an autorun package and easy to use. In addition, a DNA methylation visualization program and a differential analysis program are provided in BatMeth2. We believe that BatMeth2 will facilitate the study of the mechanisms of DNA methylation in development and disease. BatMeth2 is an open source software program and is available on GitHub ( https://github.com/GuoliangLi-HZAU/BatMeth2 /).},
