@article{Ahn:1996ty,
	abstract = {PCR has become a powerful tool for genetic analysis and many applications for gene sequence quantitation are based on this technology ( 1--3 ). Standardized reaction conditions require accurate quantitation of input DNA as well as optimization of chemical and cycling parameters. In this study we discuss PicoGreen{\texttrademark}(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) fluorescence enhancement as a useful assay for template DNA quantitation and PCR product formation.  Spectrophotometry is the principal method for evaluating quantity and quality of nucleic acids. In aqueous solution, DNA has maximal absorbance near 260 nm with an extinction coefficient of 50; protein absorbs light strongly near 280 nm. The concentration of a sample can be read directly (in µg/µl) by diluting it 1:20 in water or buffer; a practical lower limit of detection is 50--100 ng DNA in a 50--l00 µl microcuvette. The A260 / A280 ratio provides an estimate of DNA purity; values of 1.7--2.0 predict `clean DNA'. However, single-stranded DNA, RNA, PCR primers and dNTPs, or aromatic organic compounds such as phenol interfere by absorbing light in this range. Fixed tissue samples with substantial protein crosslinking and DNA preparations containing added enzymes or protein stabilizers are difficult to evaluate spectrophotometrically ( 4 ).},

@article{Heras:2016uc,
	abstract = {DNA fingerprinting is a genetic typing technique that allows the analysis of the genomic relatedness between samples, and the comparison of DNA patterns. This technique has multiple applications in different fields (medical diagnosis, forensic science, parentage testing, food industry, agriculture and many others). An important task in molecular epidemiology of infectious diseases is the analysis and comparison of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. This is applied to determine the clonal diversity of bacteria in the follow-up of outbreaks or for tracking specific clones of special relevance. The resulting images produced by DNA fingerprinting are sometimes difficult to interpret, and multiple tools have been developed to simplify this task. In this article, we present a survey of tools for analysing DNA fingerprints. In particular, we compare 33 tools using a set of predefined criteria. The comparison was carried out by hands-on experiences---whenever possible---and inspecting the documentation of the tools. As no system is preferred in all the possible scenarios, we have created a spreadsheet that can be customized by researchers to determine the best system for their needs.},

@article{Ziraldo:2019vk,
	abstract = {Next-generation DNA-sequencing (NGS) technologies, which are designed to streamline the acquisition of massive amounts of sequencing data, are nonetheless dependent on various preparative steps to generate DNA fragments of required concentration, purity and average size (molecular weight). Current automated electrophoresis systems for DNA- and RNA-sample quality control, such as Agilent's Bioanalyzer{\textregistered} and TapeStation{\textregistered} products, are costly to acquire and use; they also provide limited information for samples having broad size distributions. Here, we describe a software tool that helps determine the size distribution of DNA fragments in an NGS library, or other DNA sample, based on gel-electrophoretic line profiles. The software, developed as an ImageJ plug-in, allows for straightforward processing of gel images, including lane selection and fitting of univariate functions to intensity distributions. The user selects the option of fitting either discrete profiles in cases where discrete gel bands are visible or continuous profiles, having multiple bands buried under a single broad peak. The method requires only modest imaging capabilities and is a cost-effective, rigorous alternative characterization method to augment existing techniques for library quality control.},

@article{Skutkova:2019ui,
	abstract = {Large-scale comparative studies of DNA fingerprints prefer automated chip capillary electrophoresis over conventional gel planar electrophoresis due to the higher precision of the digitalization process. However, the determination of band sizes is still limited by the device resolution and sizing accuracy. Band matching, therefore, remains the key step in DNA fingerprint analysis. Most current methods evaluate only the pairwise similarity of the samples, using heuristically determined constant thresholds to evaluate the maximum allowed band size deviation; unfortunately, that approach significantly reduces the ability to distinguish between closely related samples. This study presents a new approach based on global multiple alignments of bands of all samples, with an adaptive threshold derived from the detailed migration analysis of a large number of real samples. The proposed approach allows the accurate automated analysis of DNA fingerprint similarities for extensive epidemiological studies of bacterial strains, thereby helping to prevent the spread of dangerous microbial infections.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory conditions show cytogenetic damage in peripheral blood leukocytes and this can be assessed using various tests. Cytogenetic damage as observed in the peripheral blood cells, is a marker of periodontal disease. DNA laddering is a sensitive assay which evaluates the cytogenetic damage. DNA laddering is a feature that can be observed when DNA fragments, resulting from apoptotic DNA fragmentation, are visualised after separation by gel electrophoresis which results in a characteristic "ladder" pattern. AIM: The aim of the present study is to investigate the cytogenetic damage in different forms of periodontitis in comparison with healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 15 systemically healthy subjects with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis (CGP), 15 systemically healthy subjects with generalised aggressive periodontitis(GAP) and 15 systemically healthy control subjects were recruited. Blood samples of the patients were drawn and evaluated for the cytogenetic damage by DNA laddering. RESULTS: Apoptotic DNA fragmentation was observed as a "ladder" pattern at 180-200 BP intervals in both CGP and GAP groups indicating the DNA damage, in contrast with the healthy group where the ladder pattern was not observed suggesting of the healthy DNA. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that there are cytogenetic damages in both the chronic and aggressive periodontitis groups incontrast to the healthy controls.},

We have previously established a robust serial dilution protocol for calibration of plate reader measurements of absorbance to estimated bacterial cell count and for green fluorescence from proteins expressed in bacterial cells to molecules of equivalent fluorescein. We now extend these protocols to calibration of red fluorescence to the sulforhodamine-101 fluorescent dye and blue fluorescence to Cascade Blue. Evaluating calibration efficacy via an interlaboratory study, we find that these calibrants do indeed provide comparable precision to the prior calibrants and that they enable effective cross-laboratory comparison of measurements of red and blue fluorescence from proteins expressed in bacterial cells.},
