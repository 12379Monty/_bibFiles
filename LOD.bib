@article{Oman:1998aa,
	abstract = {{$[$}We consider the following linear calibration problem. Two scalar quantities X and Y are related by a simple linear regression of Y on X, and at the calibration step repeated measurements on both X and Y are available for a number of sampling units. At the prediction step a Y measurement, possibly together with previously obtained Y measurements, is available for a new sampling unit, and we wish to estimate the corresponding unknown X. Both the intercept and the slope of the regression are allowed to vary between units, resulting in a random regression coefficient model at the calibration step. As a result, at the prediction step the unknown X affects both the mean and covariance structure of Y. Point and interval estimates for X are obtained and illustrated on a set of biomedical data.{$]$}},

@book{Huet:2004aa,
	abstract = {<p></p>
<p>Statistical Tools for Nonlinear Regression, (Second Edition), presents methods for analyzing data using parametric nonlinear regression models. The new edition has been expanded to include binomial, multinomial and Poisson non-linear models. Using examples from experiments in agronomy and biochemistry, it shows how to apply these methods. It concentrates on presenting the methods in an intuitive way rather than developing the theoretical backgrounds.</p> 
<p>The examples are analyzed with the free software nls2 updated to deal with the new models included in the second edition. The nls2 package is implemented in S-Plus and R. Its main advantages are to make the model building, estimation and validation tasks, easy to do. More precisely,</p> 
<p>Complex models can be easily described using a symbolic syntax. The regression function as well as the variance function can be defined explicitly as functions of independent variables and of unknown parameters or they can be defined as the solution to a system of differential equations. Moreover, constraints on the parameters can easily be added to the model. It is thus possible to test nested hypotheses and to compare several data sets. </p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Several additional tools are included in the package for calculating confidence regions for functions of parameters or calibration intervals, using classical methodology or bootstrap. Some graphical tools are proposed for visualizing the fitted curves, the residuals, the confidence regions, and the numerical estimation procedure. </p>
<p>This book is aimed at scientists who are not familiar with statistical theory, but have a basic knowledge of statistical concepts. It includes methods based on classical nonlinear regression theory and more modern methods, such as bootstrap, which have proved effective in practice. The additional chapters of the second edition assume some practical experience in data analysis using generalized linear models. The book will be of interest both for practitioners as a guide and a reference book, and for students, as a tutorial book.</p>

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To extend the polynomial method for evaluating linearity in 2 ways. First, we developed a screen to ascertain whether the data were precise enough to permit a reliable evaluation of linearity and therefore eliminate findings of linearity due to low statistical power. Second, we assessed whether the degree of nonlinearity detected by the polynomial method was clinically relevant using a statistically rigorous method. METHODS: Because we assessed linearity relative to a clinically determined level of importance instead of the default value of zero, we used sampling theory based on the noncentral chi(2) distribution. Using statistical power calculations, we incorporated a screen for imprecision that guarantees that the probability of correctly identifying nonlinear methods is at least 80%. RESULTS: With the described methods, we achieved a sensitivity of at least 80% and a specificity of at least 95%. When the data were too imprecise to achieve a sensitivity of 80%, no determination of linearity was made. This procedure mimics the practice in manual inspection of flagging data that appear imprecise by visual inspection and halting the evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Formal statistical tests for precision and amount of nonlinearity are advantageous because they allow us to quantify and limit classification errors. By formalizing these various aspects of linearity assessment, we maintain some of the complex features of manual methods while making the linearity assessment feasible to apply to a high volume of assessments and removing the between-analyst variability.},

	abstract = {Linear calibrated chemical measurements are based on the assumption of linearity. Due to influences of matrices at real samples the condition of linearity can be violated. Therefore, a profound examination has to attach much importance on the linearity of calibration. However, different procedures have been applied for this purpose in literature. In order to examine linear calibration for non-linearity, a recently presented procedure is compared with conventional techniques. The associated statistical models and estimations are represented. The applicability of the different procedures is demonstrated in some practical examples, the determination of arsenic in surface water samples taken from different sites in abandoned mining areas in central Germany. Recommendations for using the indicators and tests of non-linearity are given.},

One is often called upon to limit the reportable range in order to find the linear region. Limiting the reportable range by visual techniques is subjective, may introduce bias and is not programmable. Using Kroll and Emancipator's polynomial method for linearity, we compare the residuals of a test to determine whether eliminating a point from one end or the other of the data set worsens or improves the data sets' linearity. In an example of urinary cortisol, the root mean squares of the residuals improve by 2% when the lowest point is removed, 39% when the highest point is removed and 82% when the two highest points are removed. The latter data set is the most linear.},

These definitions may be used to develop practical criteria for linearity that are still objective. Calculation of the nonlinearity requires a method of curve-fitting.

According to the NCCLS guidelines (Document EP6-P), results of a linearity experiment are fit to a straight line and judged linear either by visual evaluation, which is subjective, or by the lack-of-fit test. This approach depends on the precision of the method, is not necessarily conclusive, and fails to be quantitative. We define linearity as a measure of how well a first-order (linear) polynomial fits the data compared with a higher-order (nonlinear) polynomial. The major property of a linear polynomial is that the first derivative is a constant. The nonlinearity of a method can be measured by the difference between these two polynomials (first-order and higher-order) at specific values or, as an average, the root-mean difference. This approach is independent of the precision of the assay and is conclusive, quantitative, and objective.},

	abstract = {In this paper we introduce new robust estimators for the logistic and probit regressions for binary, multinomial, nominal and ordinal data and apply these models to estimate the parameters when outliers or inluential observations are present. Maximum likelihood estimates don't behave well when outliers or inluential observations are present. One remedy is to remove inluential observations from the data and then apply the maximum likelihood technique on the deleted data. Another approach is to employ a robust technique that can handle outliers and inluential observations without removing any observations from the data sets. The robustness of the method is tested using real and simulated data sets.},

	n2 = {Abstract Experimenters in toxicology often compare the concentration-response relationship between two distinct populations using the median lethal concentration (LC50). This comparison is sometimes done by calculating the 95{\%} confidence interval for the LC50 for each population, concluding that no significant difference exists if the two confidence intervals overlap. A more appropriate test compares the ratio of the LC50s to 1 or the log(LC50 ratio) to 0. In this ratio test, we conclude that no difference exists in LC50s if the confidence interval for the ratio of the LC50s contains 1 or the confidence interval for the log(LC50 ratio) contains 0. A Monte Carlo simulation study was conducted to compare the confidence interval overlap test to the ratio test. The confidence interval overlap test performs substantially below the nominal α= 0.05 level, closer to p = 0.005; therefore, it has considerably less power for detecting true differences compared to the ratio test. The ratio-based method exhibited better type I error rates and superior power properties in comparison to the confidence interval overlap test. Thus, a ratio-based statistical procedure is preferred to using simple overlap of two independently derived confidence intervals.},
