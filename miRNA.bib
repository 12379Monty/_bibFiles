	abstract = {Serum and plasma are two of the most commonly used materials in clinical diagnosis and investigations. Whether differential nucleic acids exist between the serum and plasma, and the way in which they may be selected in clinical diagnosis and applications remains to be elucidated. The present study sequenced microRNAs (miRNAs) in the serum and plasma of pregnant females using next generation sequencing technology. Several differentially expressed miRNAs were also verified by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR). In total, 329 miRNAs and 193 miRNAs were detected in maternal serum and plasma. Differential expression and different types of miRNAs were found in the serum and plasma, among them, 19 were upregulated and 6 were downregulated in serum when compared with plasma with a fold change >2.0 (P<0.001). The results demonstrated that a number of miRNAs were differentially expressed in the serum and plasma, and several of the miRNAs expressed in the serum were absent in the plasma. The results obtained using RT‑qPCR in the selected miRNAs were similar to these results, and indicated that the differential expression of miRNAs in the serum and plasma provide a guide for further investigation and clinical use. The results of the analysis also suggested that differentially expressed DNA and RNA in the serum and plasma of pregnant females may be a result of the differential expression of miRNAs.},

	abstract = {Despite the promising value of miRNAs in the diagnostic and prognostic of cardiovascular disease (CVD), recent meta-analyses did not support their potential. Methodological variances in studies may interfere with miRNA profile and affect their results. This study determines if the blood starting material is a source of variance in miRNA profile by performing a paired comparison in plasma and serum of the expression of primary miRNAs associated with CVD. Circulating miRNA yield was similar in both plasma and serum, although a significant increase was observed in patients with Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) compared to control volunteers. When normalized by the expression of miR-484, different patterns of miRNA expression between serum and plasma. Although NSTEMI modified the expression of miR-1 and miR-208 in both serum and plasma, plasma displayed a higher variance than serum (Levene's test p < 0.01). For miR-133a and miR-26a, differences were only detected in serum (p = 0.0240), and conversely, miR-499a showed differences only in plasma of NSTEMI (p = 0.001). Interestingly, miR-21 showed an opposite pattern of expression, being increased in serum (2−ΔΔCt: 5.7, p = 0.0221) and decreased in plasma (2−ΔΔCt: 0.5, p = 0.0107). Plasma and serum exhibit different patterns of circulating miRNA expression in NSTEMI and suggest that results from studies with different starting material could not be comparable.},

	abstract = {Early detection of relapsed lymphoma improves response and survival. Current tools lack power for detection of early relapse, while being cumbersome and expensive. We searched for sensitive biomarkers that precede clinical relapse, and serve for further studies on therapy response and relapse. We recruited 20 healthy adults, 14 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients and 11 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients at diagnosis. Using small-RNA sequencing we identified in DLBCL patients increased plasma levels of miR-124 and miR-532-5p, and decreased levels of miR-425, miR-141, miR-145, miR-197, miR-345, miR-424, miR-128 and miR-122. In the HL group, we identified miR-25, miR-30a/d, miR-26b, miR-182, miR-186, miR-140* and miR-125a to be up-regulated, while miR-23a, miR-122, miR-93 and miR-144 were down-regulated. Pathway analysis of potential mRNAs targets of these miRNA revealed in the DLBCL group potential up-regulation of STAT3, IL8, p13k/AKT and TGF-B signaling, and potential down-regulation of the PTEN and p53 pathways; while in the HL group we have found the cAMP-mediated pathway and p53 pathway to be potentially down-regulated. Survival analyses revealed that plasma levels of miR-20a/b, miR-93 and miR-106a/b were associated with higher mortality. In conclusion, we identified sets of dysregulated circulating miRNA that might serve as reliable biomarkers for relapsed lymphoma.},

@article{Chim:2008aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The discovery of circulating fetal nucleic acids in maternal plasma has opened up new possibilities for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small RNAs, have been intensely investigated recently because of their important regulatory role in gene expression. Because nucleic acids of placental origin are released into maternal plasma, we hypothesized that miRNAs produced by the placenta would also be released into maternal plasma. METHODS: We systematically searched for placental miRNAs in maternal plasma to identify miRNAs that were at high concentrations in placentas compared with maternal blood cells and then investigated the stability and filterability of this novel class of pregnancy-associated markers in maternal plasma. RESULTS: In a panel of TaqMan MicroRNA Assays available for 157 well-established miRNAs, 17 occurred at concentrations >10-fold higher in the placentas than in maternal blood cells and were undetectable in postdelivery maternal plasma. The 4 most abundant of these placental miRNAs (miR-141, miR-149, miR-299-5p, and miR-135b) were detectable in maternal plasma during pregnancy and showed reduced detection rates in postdelivery plasma. The plasma concentration of miR-141 increased as pregnancy progressed into the third trimester. Compared with mRNA encoded by CSH1 [chorionic somatomammotropin hormone 1 (placental lactogen)], miR-141 was even more stable in maternal plasma, and its concentration did not decrease after filtration. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated the existence of placental miRNAs in maternal plasma and provide some information on their stability and physical nature. These findings open up a new class of molecular markers for pregnancy monitoring.},

	abstract = {Improved approaches for the detection of common epithelial malignancies are urgently needed to reduce the worldwide morbidity and mortality caused by cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small ( approximately 22 nt) regulatory RNAs that are frequently dysregulated in cancer and have shown promise as tissue-based markers for cancer classification and prognostication. We show here that miRNAs are present in human plasma in a remarkably stable form that is protected from endogenous RNase activity. miRNAs originating from human prostate cancer xenografts enter the circulation, are readily measured in plasma, and can robustly distinguish xenografted mice from controls. This concept extends to cancer in humans, where serum levels of miR-141 (a miRNA expressed in prostate cancer) can distinguish patients with prostate cancer from healthy controls. Our results establish the measurement of tumor-derived miRNAs in serum or plasma as an important approach for the blood-based detection of human cancer.},

The levels of specific, circulating miRNAs in blood have been shown to associate with various pathological conditions including cancers. These miRNAs have great potential as biomarkers for various pathophysiological conditions. In this study we focused on different sample types'effects on the spectrum of circulating miRNA in blood. Using serum and corresponding plasma samples from the same individuals, we observed higher miRNA concentrations in serum samples compared to the corresponding plasma samples. The difference between serum and plasma miRNA concentration showed some associations with miRNA from platelets, which may indicate that the coagulation process may affect the spectrum of extracellular miRNA in blood. Several miRNAs also showed platform dependent variations in measurements. Our results suggest that there are a number of factors that might affect the measurement of circulating miRNA concentration. Caution must be taken when comparing miRNA data generated from different sample types or measurement platforms.},

However, none of the microRNAs was differentially expressed between cases and controls (P >0.05 at false discovery rate <5{\%} in test using empirical Bayes-moderated t statistics). In classification analyses with leave-one-out internal cross-validation, cases and controls could be identified by microRNA expression with 47{\%} and 50{\%} accuracy with support vector machines and top-scoring pair methods, respectively. Cases and controls did not differ for RT-PCR-based measurements of any of the five microRNAs whose biomarker potential had been suggested by seven previous studies. Additionally, no difference for microRNA expression was noticed in microarray-based microRNA profiles of whole blood of 12 stage IA-IIIB NSCLC cases before and three-four weeks after tumor resection. These findings show that whole blood microRNA expression profiles lack diagnostic value for high-risk screening of NSCLC, though such value may exist for selective sub-groups of NSCLC and control populations.},

MATERIALS \& METHODS: The genome-wide miRNA expression was characterized by sequencing-based EdgeSeq assay in cord blood buffy coats from 89 newborns, and 564 miRNAs were further analyzed. RESULTS: Differential expression of most miRNAs was higher in boys. Neurodevelopment, RNA metabolism and metabolic ontology terms were enriched among miRNA targets. The majority of upregulated miRNAs (86{\%}) validated by nCounter maintained positive-fold change values; however, only 21{\%} reached statistical significance by false discovery rate.

	abstract = {This study examined the role of the ubiquitin E3-ligase RNF123 in modulating downstream NF-κB1 targets in glioblastoma (GB) tumor progression. Our findings revealed an oncogenic pathway (miR-155-5p-RNF123-NF-κB1-p50-SerpinE1) that may represent a new therapeutic target pathway for GB patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH) WT (wild type). Mechanistically, we demonstrated that RNF123 is downregulated in IDH WT GB patients and leads to the reduction of p50 levels. RNA-sequencing, reverse-phase protein arrays, and in vitro functional assays on IDH WT GB cell lines with RNF123 overexpression showed that SerpinE1 was a downstream target that is negatively regulated by RNF123. SERPINE1 knockdown reduced the proliferation and invasion of IDH WT GB cell lines. Both SerpinE1 and miR-155-5p overexpression negatively modulated RNF123 expression. In clinical translational analysis, RNF123, SerpinE1, and miR-155-5p were all associated with poor outcomes in GB patients. Multivariable analysis in IDH WT GB patients showed that concurrent low RNF123 and high SerpinE1 was an independent prognostic factor in predicting poor overall survival (p < 0.001, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-5.05), and an increased risk of recurrence (p < 0.001, relative risk (RR) = 3.56, 95% CI 1.61-7.83).},

	abstract = {Evolving interest in comprehensively profiling the full range of small RNAs present in small tissue biopsies and in circulating biofluids, and how the profile differs with disease, has launched small RNA sequencing (RNASeq) into more frequent use. However, known biases associated with small RNASeq, compounded by low RNA inputs, have been both a significant concern and a hurdle to widespread adoption. As RNASeq is becoming a viable choice for the discovery of small RNAs in low input samples and more labs are employing it, there should be benchmark datasets to test and evaluate the performance of new sequencing protocols and operators. In a recent publication from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Pine et al., 2018, the investigators used a commercially available set of three tissues and tested performance across labs and platforms.},

Several platforms for measurement of extracellular RNAs have recently become available. We evaluated the reproducibility, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of four miRNA quantification platforms, including one widely used discovery approach (small RNA-seq) and three targeted platforms (FirePlex, EdgeSeq, and nCounter). Using pools of synthetic miRNAs, we observed that reproducibility was highest for RNA-seq and EdgeSeq, that all three targeted platforms had lower bias than RNA-seq, and that RNA-seq had the best ability to distinguish between present and absent sequences. Overall reproducibility was lower for plasma samples than synthetic miRNA pools. We compared expression of placental miRNAs in plasma from pregnant and non-pregnant women and observed expected differences with RNA-seq and EdgeSeq, but not FirePlex or nCounter. We conclude that differences in performance among miRNA profiling platforms impact their relative utility as potential assay systems for clinical biomarkers.},

We compare four platforms for these characteristics: small RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), FirePlex, EdgeSeq, and nCounter. For a pool of synthetic miRNAs, coefficients of variation for technical replicates are lower for EdgeSeq (6.9%) and RNA-seq (8.2%) than for FirePlex (22.4%); nCounter replicates are not performed. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for distinguishing present versus absent miRNAs shows small RNA-seq (area under curve 0.99) is superior to EdgeSeq (0.97), nCounter (0.94), and FirePlex (0.81). Expected differences in expression of placenta-associated miRNAs in plasma from pregnant and non-pregnant women are observed with RNA-seq and EdgeSeq, but not FirePlex or nCounter. These results indicate that differences in performance among miRNA profiling platforms impact ability to detect biological differences among samples and thus their relative utility for research and clinical use.},

	abstract = {Squamous cell carcinoma is a common form of lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world. Identifying early stage lung squamous cell carcinoma patients who would benefit most from effective therapies will reduce the mortality. We have previously shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) were stably present in sputum and potentially useful in diagnosis of lung cancer. The objective of this study was to develop a panel of miRNAs that can be used as a sputum-based test for early stage squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs. This study contained three phases: (1) marker discovery by profiling miRNA expression signatures on 15 lung squamous cell carcinoma and matched normal lung tissue samples with GeneChip miRNA Array; (2) marker optimization by real-time quantitative RT-PCR on sputum of a case-control cohort of 48 stage I lung squamous cell carcinoma patients and 48 healthy individuals; and (3) marker validation on an independent set including 67 lung squamous cell carcinoma patients and 55 healthy subjects. On the surgical tissues, six miRNAs were identified, of which three were overexpressed and three were underexpressed in all 15 tumors. On the sputum samples of the case-control cohort, three (miR-205, miR-210 and miR-708) of the six miRNAs were selected, which in combination produced the best prediction in distinguishing lung squamous cell carcinoma patients from normal subjects with 73% sensitivity and 96% specificity. Validation of the marker panel in the independent populations confirmed the sensitivity and specificity that provided a significant improvement over any single one alone. The sputum markers showed the potential to improve the early detection of lung squamous cell carcinomas.},

Early detection of NSCLC is essential to identify potential individuals for radical cure. Although low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is recommended as standard screening with a mortality reduction of 20{\%}, it displays a high false positive rate that poses an issue of overdiagnosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small non-coding RNAs acting as important regulators in post-transcriptional gene expression and have been studied for their extensive role as novel biomarkers in NSCLC. Herein, we discuss the miRNA biology, its role in cancer, the potential of biomarkers both in cancer and NSCLC, and promising current publications of diagnostic biomarkers for early detection in NSCLC, especially studies in order to complement LDCT screening.},

Currently, the vast majority of lung cancers are diagnosed at a late stage, when patients become symptomatic leading to dismal, less than 15{\%} five-year survival rates. Evidence has demonstrated that screening computed tomography scans can be used to detect lung cancer, but these scans have high false positive rates. Therefore, there is a continued need for the development of minimally-invasive methods to screen the high risk population and diagnose lung cancer at an earlier, curable stage. One such promising area is the use micro-RNAs. These are short, non-coding RNA molecules that have been shown in previous research to be dysregulated in cancers. This review will focus on the potential use of miRNA levels in various biological fluids (whole blood, plasma, serum, and sputum) and demonstrate their potential utility as screening and diagnostic biomarkers for lung cancer. Current research will be analyzed and compared, and future directions in establishing the use of miRNAs for detecting lung cancer will be discussed.},

	abstract = {The development of a minimally invasive test, such as liquid biopsy, for early lung cancer detection in its preclinical phase is crucial to improve the outcome of this deadly disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are tissue specific, small, non-coding RNAs regulating gene expression, which may act as extracellular messengers of biological signals derived from the cross-talk between the tumor and its surrounding microenvironment. They could thus represent ideal candidates for early detection of lung cancer. In this work, a methodological workflow for the prospective validation of a circulating miRNA test using custom made microfluidic cards and quantitative Real-Time PCR in plasma samples of volunteers enrolled in a lung cancer screening trial is proposed. In addition, since the release of hemolysis-related miRNAs and more general technical issues may affect the analysis, the quality control steps included in the standard operating procedures are also presented. The protocol is reproducible and gives reliable quantitative results; however, when using large clinical series, both pre-analytical and analytical features should be cautiously evaluated.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs (∼22 nucleotides long) that post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of thousands of genes in a broad range of organisms.miRNA expression profiling is useful for identifying miRNAs that are important in the regulation of a range of processes, including organismal development, tissue differentiation and disease pathology.miRNAs show promise as biomarkers for various diseases.miRNAs are more stable than mRNAs in many specimen types and are more readily measured than proteins. However, sample type, processing and RNA extraction methods can have a substantial impact on the results of miRNA profiling, and therefore quality and quantity assessment is recommended.Biogenesis of miRNAs occurs through multiple steps and includes the intermediate primary miRNA and precursor miRNA forms, as well as post-transcriptional nucleotide additions and deletions, leading to 'isomiRs'. Choice of platform and analysis in miRNA profiling should include consideration of the need to distinguish between different forms of miRNAs.Three main approaches are currently well established for miRNA profiling: quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), hybridization-based methods (for example, DNA microarrays) and high-throughput sequencing (that is, RNA sequencing). The optimal choice of platform depends on the specific experimental goals.Analysis of miRNA-profiling data typically includes data processing, data quality assessment, data normalization and calculation of differential expression. The optimal approach to data analysis depends on the platform selected and the nature of the experiment.},

Among emerging circulating biomarkers, cell-free miRNA (cfmiRNA) may have potential in detecting lung cancer and following the course of the disease. Furthermore, several studies highlighted the possibility to utilize these regulatory RNAs to obtain prognostic information as well as to verify patient's response towards treatment. However, despite these findings, cfmiRNA is not used in the clinical practice as biomarkers to date, since their clinical utility and validity has not been confirmed in prospective clinical studies yet. In addition, there is no consensus on standardized (pre)analytical procedures. In this review, we present an overview of cfmiRNA biomarker candidates for clinical management of lung cancer and we discuss the issue of assay standardization.},

@article{Montani:2015aa,
	abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Low-dose computed tomography screening (LDCT) was recently shown to anticipate the time of diagnosis, thus reducing lung cancer mortality. However, concerns persist about the feasibility and costs of large-scale LDCT programs. Such concerns may be addressed by clearly defining the target "high-risk" population that needs to be screened by LDCT. We recently identified a serum microRNA signature (the miR-Test) that could identify the optimal target population. Here, we performed a large-scale validation study of the miR-Test in high-risk individuals (n = 1115) enrolled in the Continuous Observation of Smoking Subjects (COSMOS) lung cancer screening program. The overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the miR-Test are 74.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 72.2% to 77.6%), 77.8% (95% CI = 64.2% to 91.4%), and 74.8% (95% CI = 72.1% to 77.5%), respectively; the area under the curve is 0.85 (95% CI = 0.78 to 0.92). These results argue that the miR-Test might represent a useful tool for lung cancer screening in high-risk individuals.},

@article{Rosenwald:2010aa,
	abstract = {Identification of the tissue of origin of a tumor is vital to its management. Previous studies showed tissue-specific expression patterns of microRNA and suggested that microRNA profiling would be useful in addressing this diagnostic challenge. MicroRNAs are well preserved in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, further supporting this approach. To develop a standardized assay for identification of the tissue origin of FFPE tumor samples, we used microarray data from 504 tumor samples to select a shortlist of 104 microRNA biomarker candidates. These 104 microRNAs were profiled by proprietary quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on 356 FFPE tumor samples. A total of 48 microRNAs were chosen from this list of candidates and used to train a classifier. We developed a clinical test for the identification of the tumor tissue of origin based on a standardized protocol and defined the classification criteria. The test measures expression levels of 48 microRNAs by qRT-PCR, and predicts the tissue of origin among 25 possible classes, corresponding to 17 distinct tissues and organs. The biologically motivated classifier combines the predictions generated by a binary decision tree and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). The classifier was validated on an independent, blinded set of 204 FFPE tumor samples, including nearly 100 metastatic tumor samples. The test predictions correctly identified the reference diagnosis in 85% of the cases. In 66% of the cases the two algorithm predictions (tree and KNN) agreed on a single-tissue origin, which was identical to the reference diagnosis in 90% of cases. Thus, a qRT-PCR test based on the expression profile of 48 tissue-specific microRNAs allows accurate identification of the tumor tissue of origin.},
