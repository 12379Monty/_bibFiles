	abstract = {The immune composition of the tumor microenvironment regulates processes including angiogenesis, metastasis, and the response to drugs or immunotherapy. To facilitate the characterization of the immune component of tumors from transcriptomics data, a number of immune cell transcriptome signatures have been reported that are made up of lists of marker genes indicative of the presence a given immune cell population. The majority of these gene signatures have been defined through analysis of isolated blood cells. However, blood cells do not reflect the differentiation or activation state of similar cells within tissues, including tumors, and consequently markers derived from blood cells do not necessarily transfer well to tissues. To address this issue, we generated a set of immune gene signatures derived directly from tissue transcriptomics data using a network-based deconvolution approach. We define markers for seven immune cell types, collectively named ImSig, and demonstrate how these markers can be used for the quantitative estimation of the immune cell content of tumor and nontumor tissue samples. The utility of ImSig is demonstrated through the stratification of melanoma patients into subgroups of prognostic significance and the identification of immune cells with the use of single-cell RNA-sequencing data derived from tumors. Use of ImSig is facilitated by an R package (imsig). Cancer Immunol Res; 6(11); 1388-400. {\copyright}2018 AACR.},

	abstract = {Although ample evidence indicates that immune cell homeostasis is an important prognostic outcome determinant in patients with cancer, few studies have examined whether it also determines cancer risk among initially healthy individuals. We performed a case-cohort study including incident cases of breast (n = 207), colorectal (n = 111), lung (n = 70), and prostate (n = 201) cancer as well as a subcohort (n = 465) within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Heidelberg cohort. Relative counts of neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocyte sublineages were measured by qRT-PCR. HRs and 95% confidence intervals were used to measure the associations between relative counts of immune cell and cancer risks. When relative counts of immune cell types were taken individually, a significant positive association was observed between relative counts of FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) and lung cancer risk, and significant inverse associations were observed between relative CD8(+) counts and risks of lung and breast cancer (overall and ER+ subtype). Multivariable models with mutual adjustments across immune markers showed further significant positive associations between higher relative FOXP3(+) T-cell counts and increased risks of colorectal and breast cancer (overall and ER- subtype). No associations were found between immune cell composition and prostate cancer risk. These results affirm the relevance of elevated FOXP3(+) Tregs and lower levels of cytotoxic (CD8(+)) T cells as risk factors for tumor development. SIGNIFICANCE: This epidemiologic study supports a role for both regulatory and cytotoxic T cells in determining cancer risk among healthy individuals.See related commentary by Song and Tworoger, p. 1801.},

	abstract = {Blood-based liquid biopsies, including tumor-educated blood platelets (TEPs), have emerged as promising biomarker sources for non-invasive detection of cancer. Here we demonstrate that particle-swarm optimization (PSO)-enhanced algorithms enable efficient selection of RNA biomarker panels from platelet RNA-sequencing libraries (n = 779). This resulted in accurate TEP-based detection of early- and late-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (n = 518 late-stage validation cohort, accuracy, 88%; AUC, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92-0.96; p < 0.001; n = 106 early-stage validation cohort, accuracy, 81%; AUC, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83-0.95; p < 0.001), independent of age of the individuals, smoking habits, whole-blood storage time, and various inflammatory conditions. PSO enabled selection of gene panels to diagnose cancer from TEPs, suggesting that swarm intelligence may also benefit the optimization of diagnostics readout of other liquid biopsy biosources.},

While chemotherapy and other treatments have improved, the 5 year survival rate of NSCLC patients is still only 21{\%}. Early diagnosis is essential for increasing survival as treatments have higher effectiveness at earlier stages of NSCLC. Noninvasive blood-based liquid biopsy tests for NSCLC may be useful for diagnosis and prognosis. MicroRNA (miRNA) and messenger RNA present in blood can serve as biomarkers for such tests. The present study identified 13 miRNAs that are underexpressed in the tissue and blood of NSCLC patients using Gene Expression Omnibus data. Following Kaplan Meier analysis, miR-140-3p, miR-29c, and miR-199a were selected as candidate biomarkers and demonstrated statistically significant prognostic power. An ROC analysis of miR-140-3p expression between NSCLC patients and controls had an area under curve value of 0.85. Functional enrichment analysis of the miRNA target genes revealed several overrepresented pathways relevant to cancer. Eight target genes were hub genes of the protein protein interaction network and possessed significant prognostic power. A combination of IL6, SNAI1, and CDK6 achieved a hazard ratio of 1.4 with p \&lt; 0.001. These biomarkers are especially valuable because they can be identified in blood and reflect the tumor state. Since all miRNAs were underexpressed in both tissue and blood, detecting expression of a biomarker miRNA in blood provides information on its expression in tissue as well. These miRNAs may be useful biomarkers for NSCLC prognostic and diagnostic tests and should be further studied.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialAs this study only used publicly available data and was computational, no clinical trial ID was necessary.Funding StatementNo funding was received.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:No IRB approval was necessary.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

@article{Wang:2019aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) CCAT1 and SOX2OT have been shown to play important regulatory roles in cancer biology. Tumor biomarkers need to be detectable in easily accessible body fluids, should be characterized by high specificity, sufficient sensitivity, and robustness against influencing factors. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical significance of serum CCAT1 and SOX2OT as a biomarker in the screening of NSCLC. RESULTS: CCAT1 and SOX2OT were shown to be detectable in the cellular fraction of peripheral human blood, showing serum levels of CCAT1 and SOX2OT were significantly increased of cancer patients as compared to cancer-free controls. The ROC curves illustrated strong separation between the NSCLC patients and control group, with an AUC of 0.846 (95{\%} CI 0.766-0.926; P < 0.001) for CCAT1 and 0.787 (95{\%} CI: 0.691-0.883; P < 0.001) for SOX2OT. However, the combination of SOX2OT and CCAT1 yielded an AUC of 0.894 (95{\%} CI: 0.825-0.963; P < 0.001), which was significantly improved as compared to CCAT1 or SOX2OT alone. Moreover, the interaction between lncRNAs and some functional proteins, such as TTF1, p63, Ck7, K-ras, EGFR, may contribute to the tumorigenesis. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that increased serum CCAT1 and SOX2OT could be used as a predictive biomarker for NSCLC screening, and that combination of CCAT1 and SOX2OT had a higher positive diagnostic efficiency of NSCLC than CCAT1 or SOX2OT alone.},

	abstract = {Background: Currently, there are no molecular biomarkers for the early detection of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study focused on identifying RNAs found on tumor-educated blood platelets (TEPs) for detecting stage I NSCLC. Methods: Platelet RNAs, isolated from the blood of 9 patients with NSCLC (stages I and II) and 8 healthy controls, were analyzed using RNA-seq. ITGA2B was selected as a candidate marker. Two different Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR) were used to measure ITGA2B in platelet samples from healthy controls (n = 150), patients with NSCLC (n = 243), and patients with benign pulmonary nodules (n = 141) in two cohorts. Results: Platelet ITGA2B levels were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in patients with NSCLC than in all controls. The diagnostic accuracy of ITGA2B was area under the curve (AUC) of 0.922 {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.892-0.952{$]$}, sensitivity of 92.8{\%}, and specificity of 78.6{\%} in the test cohort and 0.888, 91.2{\%}, and 56.5{\%} in the validation cohort for NSCLC by quantitative real time PCR (q-PCR). Furthermore, ITGA2B maintained diagnostic accuracy for patients with NSCLC using Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) and the other type of internal control, Ribosomal Protein L32 (RPL32) {$[$}ddPCR: 0.967 (0.929-1.000) and RPL32: 0.847(0.773-0.920){$]$}. A nomogram incorporating ITGA2B, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and stage could predict the overall survival (C-index = 0.756). Conclusions: TEP ITGA2B is a promising marker to improve identification of patients with stage I NSCLC and differentiate malignant from benign lung nodules.},

	abstract = {Extracellular vesicles are selectively enriched in RNA that has potential as disease biomarkers. To systemically characterize circulating extracellular RNA (exRNA) profiles, we performed RNA sequencing analysis on plasma extracellular vesicles derived from 50 healthy individuals and 142 cancer patients. Of \~{}12.6 million raw reads for each individual, the number of mappable reads aligned to RNA references was \~{}5.4 million including miRNAs (\~{}40.4{\%}), piwiRNAs (\~{}40.0{\%}), pseudo-genes (\~{}3.7{\%}), lncRNAs (\~{}2.4{\%}), tRNAs (\~{}2.1{\%}) and mRNAs (\~{}2.1{\%}). By expression stability testing, we identified a set of miRNAs showing relatively consistent expression, which may serve as reference control for exRNA quantification. By performing multivariate analysis of covariance, we identified significant associations of these exRNAs with age, sex and different types of cancers. In particular, down-regulation of miR-125a-5p and miR-1343-3p showed an association with all cancer types tested (false discovery rate <0.05). We developed multivariate statistical models to predict cancer status with an area under the curve from 0.68 to 0.92 depending cancer type and staging. This is the largest RNA-seq study to date for profiling exRNA species, which has not only provided a baseline reference profile for circulating exRNA, but also revealed a set of RNA candidates for reference controls and disease biomarkers.},

Cell-free circulating miRNAs were proposed as candidate biomarkers for lung cancer. These RNAs are frequently deregulated in lung cancer and can persist in bodily fluids for extended periods of time, shielded from degradation by membrane vesicles and biopolymer complexes. To date, several groups reported the presence of lung tumour-specific subsets of miRNAs in blood. Here we describe the profiling of blood plasma miRNAs in lung cancer patients, healthy individuals and endobronchitis patients using miRCURY LNA miRNA qPCR Serum/Plasma Panel (Exiqon). From 241 ratios differently expressed between cancer patients and healthy individuals 19 miRNAs were selected for verification using the same platform.
