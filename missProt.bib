	abstract = {In this review, we apply selected imputation strategies to label-free liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) proteomics datasets to evaluate the accuracy with respect to metrics of variance and classification. We evaluate several commonly used imputation approaches for individual merits and discuss the caveats of each approach with respect to the example LC-MS proteomics data. In general, local similarity-based approaches, such as the regularized expectation maximization and least-squares adaptive algorithms, yield the best overall performances with respect to metrics of accuracy and robustness. However, no single algorithm consistently outperforms the remaining approaches, and in some cases, performing classification without imputation sometimes yielded the most accurate classification. Thus, because of the complex mechanisms of missing data in proteomics, which also vary from peptide to protein, no individual method is a single solution for imputation. On the basis of the observations in this review, the goal for imputation in the field of computational proteomics should be to develop new approaches that work generically for this data type and new strategies to guide users in the selection of the best imputation for their dataset and analysis objectives.},

@misc{Ma:2020aa,
	abstract = {Deep proteomics profiling using labelled LC-MS/MS experiments has been proven to be powerful to study complex diseases. However, due to the dynamic nature of the discovery mass spectrometry, the generated data contain a substantial fraction of missing values. This poses great challenges for data analyses, as many tools, especially those for high dimensional data, cannot deal with missing values directly. To address this problem, the NCI-CPTAC Proteogenomics DREAM Challenge was carried out to develop effective imputation algorithms for labelled LC-MS/MS proteomics data through crowd learning. The final resulting algorithm, DreamAI, is based on an ensemble of six different imputation methods. The imputation accuracy of DreamAI, as measured by correlation, is about 15{\%}-50{\%} greater than existing tools among less abundant proteins, which are more vulnerable to be missed in proteomics data sets. This new tool nicely enhances data analysis capabilities in proteomics research.},

@article{Jin:2021aa,
	abstract = {The presence of missing values (MVs) in label-free quantitative proteomics greatly reduces the completeness of data. Imputation has been widely utilized to handle MVs, and selection of the proper method is critical for the accuracy and reliability of imputation. Here we present a comparative study that evaluates the performance of seven popular imputation methods with a large-scale benchmark dataset and an immune cell dataset. Simulated MVs were incorporated into the complete part of each dataset with different combinations of MV rates and missing not at random (MNAR) rates. Normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) was applied to evaluate the accuracy of protein abundances and intergroup protein ratios after imputation. Detection of true positives (TPs) and false altered-protein discovery rate (FADR) between groups were also compared using the benchmark dataset. Furthermore, the accuracy of handling real MVs was assessed by comparing enriched pathways and signature genes of cell activation after imputing the immune cell dataset. We observed that the accuracy of imputation is primarily affected by the MNAR rate rather than the MV rate, and downstream analysis can be largely impacted by the selection of imputation methods. A random forest-based imputation method consistently outperformed other popular methods by achieving the lowest NRMSE, high amount of TPs with the average FADR < 5{\%}, and the best detection of relevant pathways and signature genes, highlighting it as the most suitable method for label-free proteomics.},

	n2 = {Recent developments in mass spectrometry (MS) instruments and data acquisition modes have aided multiplexed, fast, reproducible and quantitative analysis of proteome profiles, yet missing values remain a formidable challenge for proteomics data analysis. The stochastic nature of sampling in Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA), suboptimal preprocessing of Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) runs and dynamic range limitation of MS instruments impedes the reproducibility and accuracy of peptide quantification and can introduce systematic patterns of missingness that impact downstream analyses. Thus, imputation of missing values becomes an important element of data analysis. We introduce msImpute, an imputation method based on low-rank approximation, and compare it to six alternative imputation methods using public DDA and DIA datasets. We evaluate the performance of methods by determining the error of imputed values and accuracy of detection of differential expression. We also measure the post-imputation preservation of structures in the data at different levels of granularity. We develop a visual diagnostic to determine the nature of missingness in datasets based on peptides with high biological dropout rate and introduce a method to identify such peptides. Our findings demonstrate that msImpute performs well when data are missing at random and highlights the importance of prior knowledge about nature of missing values in a dataset when selecting an imputation technique.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.DEDifferential ExpressionMARMissing At RandomMCARMissing Completely At RandomMNARMissing Not At RandomSVDSingular Value DecompositionFDRFalse Discovery RateMSMass SpectrometryLC-MSLiquid Chromatography - Mass SpectrometryDDAData-dependent AcquisitionDDAData-independent AcquisitionALSAlternating Least SquaresRMSERoot Mean Squared ErrorHBDHigh Biological DropoutLOQlimits of quantificationPCPrincipal Components},

Nevertheless, well-principled statistical inference procedures are still lacking, and most practitioners adopt methods from transcriptomics. These, however, cannot properly treat the principal complication of label-free proteomics, namely many non-randomly missing values.We present proDA, a method to perform statistical tests for differential abundance of proteins. It models missing values in an intensity-dependent probabilistic manner. proDA is based on linear models and thus suitable for complex experimental designs, and boosts statistical power for small sample sizes by using variance moderation. We show that the currently widely used methods based on ad hoc imputation schemes can report excessive false positives, and that proDA not only overcomes this serious issue but also offers high sensitivity. Thus, proDA fills a crucial gap in the toolbox of quantitative proteomics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
