	abstract = {Characterization and quantification of climate extremes and their dependencies are fundamental to the studying of natural hazards. This chapter reviews various parametric and nonparametric tail dependence coefficient estimators. The tail dependence coefficient describes the dependence (degree of association) between concurrent extremes at different locations. Accurate and reliable knowledge of the spatial characteristics of extremes can help improve the existing methods of modeling the occurrence probabilities of extreme events. This chapter will review these methods and use two case studies to demonstrate the application of tail dependence analysis.},

	n2 = {Abstract Extreme climatic events (ECEs) are becoming more frequent and more intense due to climate change. Furthermore, there is reason to believe ECEs may modify 'tail associations' between distinct population vital rates, or between values of an environmental variable measured in different locations. 'Tail associations' between two variables are associations that occur between values in the left or right tails of the distributions of the variables. Two positively associated variables can be principally 'left-tail associated' (i.e., more correlated when they take low values than when they take high values) or 'right-tail associated' (more correlated when they take high than low values), even with the same overall correlation coefficient in both cases. We tested, in the context of non-spatial stage-structured matrix models, whether tail associations between stage-specific vital rates may influence extinction risk. We also tested whether the nature of spatial tail associations of environmental variables can influence metapopulation extinction risk. For instance, if low values of an environmental variable reduce the growth rates of local populations, one may expect that left-tail associations increase metapopulation extinction risks because then environmental 'catastrophes' are spatially synchronized, presumably reducing the potential for rescue effects. For the non-spatial, stage-structured models we considered, left-tail associations between vital rates did accentuate extinction risk compared to right-tail associations, but the effect was small. In contrast, we showed that density dependence interacts with tail associations to influence metapopulation extinction risk substantially: For population models showing undercompensatory density dependence, left-tail associations in environmental variables often strongly accentuated and right-tail associations mitigated extinction risk, whereas the reverse was usually true for models showing overcompensatory density dependence. Tail associations and their asymmetries are taken into account in assessing risks in finance and other fields, but to our knowledge, our study is one of the first to consider how tail associations influence population extinction risk. Our modeling results provide an initial demonstration of a new mechanism influencing extinction risks and, in our view, should help motivate more comprehensive study of the mechanism and its importance for real populations in future work.},

@article{Viladomat:2014aa,
	abstract = {We propose a method to test the correlation of two random fields when they are both spatially autocorrelated. In this scenario, the assumption of independence for the pair of observations in the standard test does not hold, and as a result we reject in many cases where there is no effect (the precision of the null distribution is overestimated). Our method recovers the null distribution taking into account the autocorrelation. It uses Monte-Carlo methods, and focuses on permuting, and then smoothing and scaling one of the variables to destroy the correlation with the other, while maintaining at the same time the initial autocorrelation. With this simulation model, any test based on the independence of two (or more) random fields can be constructed. This research was motivated by a project in biodiversity and conservation in the Biology Department at Stanford University.},
