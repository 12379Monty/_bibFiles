	abstract = {The interpretation of forensic fingerprint evidence relies on the expertise of latent print examiners. We tested latent print examiners on the extent to which they reached consistent decisions. This study assessed intra-examiner repeatability by retesting 72 examiners on comparisons of latent and exemplar fingerprints, after an interval of approximately seven months; each examiner was reassigned 25 image pairs for comparison, out of total pool of 744 image pairs. We compare these repeatability results with reproducibility (inter-examiner) results derived from our previous study. Examiners repeated 89.1% of their individualization decisions, and 90.1% of their exclusion decisions; most of the changed decisions resulted in inconclusive decisions. Repeatability of comparison decisions (individualization, exclusion, inconclusive) was 90.0% for mated pairs, and 85.9% for nonmated pairs. Repeatability and reproducibility were notably lower for comparisons assessed by the examiners as "difficult" than for "easy" or "moderate" comparisons, indicating that examiners' assessments of difficulty may be useful for quality assurance. No false positive errors were repeated (n = 4); 30% of false negative errors were repeated. One percent of latent value decisions were completely reversed (no value even for exclusion vs. of value for individualization). Most of the inter- and intra-examiner variability concerned whether the examiners considered the information available to be sufficient to reach a conclusion; this variability was concentrated on specific image pairs such that repeatability and reproducibility were very high on some comparisons and very low on others. Much of the variability appears to be due to making categorical decisions in borderline cases.},

	abstract = {Assessing the matching error rates of a biometric identification devices is integral to understanding its performance. Here we propose and evaluate several methods for creating approximate confidence intervals for matching error rates. Testing of biometric identification devices is recognized as inducing intra-individual correlation. In order to estimate error rates associated with these devices, it is necessary to deal with these correlations. In this paper, we consider extensions of recent work on adjustments to confidence intervals for binomial proportions to correlated binary proportions. In particular we propose a Agresti-Coull type adjustment for estimation of a proportion. Here that proportion represents an error rate. We use an overdispersion model to account for intra-individual correlation. To evaluate this approach we simulate data from a Beta-binomial distribution and assess the coverage for nominally 95{\%} confidence intervals.},

	abstract = {Testing of biometric devices to determine whether or not their error rates meet a specified threshold is often an important criterion for determining whether or not a device will be deployed. One consideration for this is how much testing is to be completed. In this paper we apply sequential testing methodology to testing whether or not a biometric device has an error rate below a certain bound. This approach has the advantage that the testing can be stopped at any time. A decision can be made once there is enough evidence to support or reject the hypothesis of interest. Application is made to biometric error rate data for three different modalities -facial recognition, hand geometry and fingerprints. Our results show that this approach can produce more efficient and less costly tests of biometric devices.},

	abstract = {Discrete data from animal teratology experiments are known to exhibit extra-binomial variation. For example, we discuss a dominant lethal assay experiment in which male mice are exposed to various levels of radiation and are then mated to females. The response of interest is the number of resorptions out of the number of implantations. Most statistical work on analyzing such data has focused on modeling response rates as a function of dose of a suspected teratogen (radiation in this case) while accounting for the extra-binomial variability when calculating standard errors of the regression coefficients. Sometimes, however, when an unobserved genetic or exposure variable is suspected, the shape of the mixing distribution is of interest. We propose a mixture of beta-binomials (MBB) family of distributions that includes the non-parametric mixture of binomials model of Laird (1978) as a special case. The MBB family can accommodate a mixing distribution with one or more modes, and we develop a bootstrap test for multimodality. We apply the method to data from a dominant lethal teratology experiment.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The invention of next-generation sequencing technology has made it possible to study the rare variants that are more likely to pinpoint causal disease genes. To make such experiments financially viable, DNA samples from several subjects are often pooled before sequencing. This induces large between-pool variation which, together with other sources of experimental error, creates over-dispersed data. Statistical analysis of pooled sequencing data needs to appropriately model this additional variance to avoid inflating the false-positive rate.Results: We propose a new statistical method based on an extra-binomial model to address the over-dispersion and apply it to pooled case-control data. We demonstrate that our model provides a better fit to the data than either a standard binomial model or a traditional extra-binomial model proposed by Williams and can analyse both rare and common variants with lower or more variable pool depths compared to the other methods.Availability: Package `extraBinomial'is on http://cran.r-project.org/Contact: chris.wallace{\char64}cimr.cam.ac.ukSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics Online.},
