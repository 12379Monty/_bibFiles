@article{Lu:2023aa,
	abstract = {Summary DNA sample contamination is a major issue in clinical and research applications of whole-genome and -exome sequencing. Even modest levels of contamination can substantially affect the overall quality of variant calls and lead to widespread genotyping errors. Currently, popular tools for estimating the contamination level use short-read data (BAM/CRAM files), which are expensive to store and manipulate and often not retained or shared widely. We propose a metric to estimate DNA sample contamination from variant-level whole-genome and -exome sequence data called CHARR, contamination from homozygous alternate reference reads, which leverages the infiltration of reference reads within homozygous alternate variant calls. CHARR uses a small proportion of variant-level genotype information and thus can be computed from single-sample gVCFs or callsets in VCF or BCF formats, as well as efficiently stored variant calls in Hail VariantDataset format. Our results demonstrate that CHARR accurately recapitulates results from existing tools with substantially reduced costs, improving the accuracy and efficiency of downstream analyses of ultra-large whole-genome and exome sequencing datasets.},

	n2 = {Low levels of sample contamination with other human DNAs can have disastrous effects on the accurate identification of somatic variation in tumor samples. Detection of sample contamination in DNA is often based on low frequency variants that indicate if more than a single source of DNA is present. This strategy works with standard DNA samples but can be problematic in solid tumor FFPE samples because there are often huge variations in allele frequency (AF) due to copy number changes arising from gains and losses across the genome. The variable AFs make detection of contamination challenging. To avoid this, we counted microhaplotypes to assess sample contamination. Microhaplotypes are sets of variants on the same sequencing read that can be unambiguously phased. Instead of measuring AF, the number of microhaplotypes is determined. Contamination detection becomes based on fundamental genomic properties, linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the diploid nature of human DNA, rather than variant frequencies. We optimized microhaplotype panel content and selected 164 SNV sets located in regions already being sequenced within a cancer panel. Thus, contamination detection uses existing sequence data. LD data from the 1000 Genomes Project is used to make the panel ancestry agnostic, providing the same sensitivity for contamination detection with samples from individuals of African, East Asian, and European ancestry. Detection of 1{\%} contamination with no matching normal sample is possible. The methods described here can also be extended to other DNA mixtures such as forensic and non-invasive prenatal testing samples where DNA mixes can be similarly detected. The microhaplotype method allows sensitive detection of DNA contamination in FFPE tumor and other samples when deep coverage with Illumina or other high accuracy NGS is used.Competing Interest StatementBoth authors are former employees of PGDx and have stock options in the company.AdAmAdmixed AmericanAFAllele FrequencyAfAmAfrican AmericanAfriAfricancfDNAcirculating free DNAEaAsEast AsianEuroEuropeanFFPEFormalin-fixed Paraffin-embeddedFPFalse PositiveLDLinkage DisequilibriumMHMicrohaplotypeNGSNext-generation SequencingNIPTNon-invasive Prenatal TestingPCAPrinciple Component AnalysisSNVSingle Nucleotide VariantSoAsSouth AsianSTRShort Tandem Repeat},

	abstract = {The surveillance and prevention of pathogenic microbiological contamination are the most important tasks of biosafety management in the lab. There is an urgent need to establish an effective and unbiased method to evaluate and monitor such contamination. This study aims to investigate the utility of next generation sequencing (NGS) method to detect possible contamination in the microbiology laboratory. Environmental samples were taken at multiple sites at the lab including the inner site of centrifuge rotor, the bench used for molecular biological tests, the benches of biosafety cabinets used for viral culture, clinical sample pre-treatment and nucleic acids extraction, by scrubbing the sites using sterile flocked swabs. The extracted total nucleic acids were used to construct the libraries for deep sequencing according to the protocol of Ion Torrent platform. At least 1G raw data was obtained for each sample. The reads of viruses and bacteria accounted for 0.01 $\pm$0.02{\%}, and 77.76 $\pm$12.53{\%} of total reads respectively. The viral sequences were likely to be derived from gene amplification products, the nucleic acids contaminated in fetal bovine serum. Reads from environmental microorganisms were also identified. Our results suggested that NGS method was capable of monitoring the nucleic acids contaminations from different sources in the lab, demonstrating its promising utility in monitoring and assessing the risk of potential laboratory contamination. The risk of contamination from reagents, remnant DNA and environment should be considered in data analysis and results interpretation.},

	abstract = {Misidentification and contamination of biobank samples (e.g. cell lines) have plagued biomedical research. Short tandem repeat (STR) and single-nucleotide polymorphism assays are widely used to authenticate biosamples and detect contamination, but with insufficient sensitivity at 5-10% and 3-5%, respectively. Here, we describe a deep NGS-based method with significantly higher sensitivity (≤1%). It can be used to authenticate human and mouse cell lines, xenografts and organoids. It can also reliably identify and quantify contamination of human cell line samples, contaminated with only small amount of other cell samples; detect and quantify species-specific components in human-mouse mixed samples (e.g. xenografts) with 0.1% sensitivity; detect mycoplasma contamination; and infer population structure and gender of human samples. By adopting DNA barcoding technology, we are able to profile 100-200 samples in a single run at per-sample cost comparable to conventional STR assays, providing a truly high-throughput and low-cost assay for building and maintaining high-quality biobanks.},

@article{Bergmann:2016aa,
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Sequencing of matched tumor and normal samples is the standard study design for reliable detection of somatic alterations. However, even very low levels of cross-sample contamination significantly impact calling of somatic mutations, because contaminant germline variants can be incorrectly interpreted as somatic. There are currently no sequence-only based methods that reliably estimate contamination levels in tumor samples, which frequently display copy number changes. As a solution, we developed Conpair, a tool for detection of sample swaps and cross-individual contamination in whole-genome and whole-exome tumor-normal sequencing experiments. RESULTS: On a ladder of in silico contaminated samples, we demonstrated that Conpair reliably measures contamination levels as low as 0.1%, even in presence of copy number changes. We also estimated contamination levels in glioblastoma WGS and WXS tumor-normal datasets from TCGA and showed that they strongly correlate with tumor-normal concordance, as well as with the number of germline variants called as somatic by several widely-used somatic callers.

@article{Balan:2023aa,
	abstract = {Innovation in sequencing instrumentation is increasing the per-batch data volumes and decreasing the per-base costs. Multiplexed chemistry protocols after the addition of index tags have further contributed to efficient and cost-effective sequencer utilization. With these pooled processing strategies, however, comes an increased risk of sample contamination. Sample contamination poses a risk of missing critical variants in a patient sample or wrongly reporting variants derived from the contaminant, which are particularly relevant issues in oncology specimen testing in which low variant allele frequencies have clinical relevance. Small custom-targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels yield limited variants and pose challenges in delineating true somatic variants versus contamination calls. A number of popular contamination identification tools have the ability to perform well in whole-genome/exome sequencing data; however, in smaller gene panels, there are fewer variant candidates for the tools to perform accurately. To prevent clinical reporting of potentially contaminated samples in small next-generation sequencing panels, we have developed MICon (Microhaplotype Contamination detection), a novel contamination detection model that uses microhaplotype site variant allele frequencies. In a heterogeneous hold-out test cohort of 210 samples, the model displayed state-of-the-art performance with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.995.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Next generation sequencing (ngs) is becoming the standard for clinical diagnosis. Different steps of NGS, such as DNA extraction, fragmentation, library preparation and amplification, require handling of samples, making the process susceptible to contamination. In diagnostic environments, sample contamination with DNA from the same species can lead to errors in diagnosis. Here we propose a simple method to detect within-sample contamination based on analysis of the heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms allele ratio (AR). METHODS: A dataset of 38000 heterozygous snps was used to estimate the ar distribution. The parameters of the reference distribution were then used to estimate the contamination probability of a sample. Validation was performed using 12 samples contaminated to different levels. RESULTS: Results show that the method easily detects contamination of 20% or more. The method has a limit of detection of about 10%, threshold below which the number of false positives increases significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The method can be applied to any type of ngs analysis and is useful for quality control. Being fast and easy to implement makes it ideal for inclusion in NGS pipelines to improve quality control of data and make results more robust.},

	abstract = {DNA sample contamination is a serious problem in DNA sequencing studies and may result in systematic genotype misclassification and false positive associations. Although methods exist to detect and filter out cross-species contamination, few methods to detect within-species sample contamination are available. In this paper, we describe methods to identify within-species DNA sample contamination based on (1) a combination of sequencing reads and array-based genotype data, (2) sequence reads alone, and (3) array-based genotype data alone. Analysis of sequencing reads allows contamination detection after sequence data is generated but prior to variant calling; analysis of array-based genotype data allows contamination detection prior to generation of costly sequence data. Through a combination of analysis of in silico and experimentally contaminated samples, we show that our methods can reliably detect and estimate levels of contamination as low as 1%. We evaluate the impact of DNA contamination on genotype accuracy and propose effective strategies to screen for and prevent DNA contamination in sequencing studies.},
