	abstract = {Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a new technology that was recently commercialized to enable the precise quantification of target nucleic acids in a sample. ddPCR measures absolute quantities by counting nucleic acid molecules encapsulated in discrete, volumetrically defined, water-in-oil droplet partitions. This novel ddPCR format offers a simple workflow capable of generating highly stable partitioning of DNA molecules. In this study, we assessed key performance parameters of the ddPCR system. A linear ddPCR response to DNA concentration was obtained from 0.16% through to 99.6% saturation in a 20,000 droplet assay corresponding to more than 4 orders of magnitude of target DNA copy number per ddPCR. Analysis of simplex and duplex assays targeting two distinct loci in the Lambda DNA genome using the ddPCR platform agreed, within their expanded uncertainties, with values obtained using a lower density microfluidic chamber based digital PCR (cdPCR). A relative expanded uncertainty under 5% was achieved for copy number concentration using ddPCR. This level of uncertainty is much lower than values typically observed for quantification of specific DNA target sequences using currently commercially available real-time and digital cdPCR technologies.},

	abstract = {Classification of gliomas involves the combination of histological features with molecular biomarkers to establish an integrated histomolecular diagnosis. Here, we report on the application and validation of a set of molecular assays for glioma diagnostics based on digital PCR technology using the QX200{\texttrademark} Droplet Digital{\texttrademark} PCR (ddPCR) system. The investigated ddPCR-based assays enable the detection of diagnostically relevant glioma-associated mutations in the IDH1, IDH2, H3-3A, BRAF, and PRKCA genes, as well as in the TERT promoter. In addition, ddPCR-based assays assessing diagnostically relevant copy number alterations were studied, including 1p/19q codeletion, gain of chromosome 7 and loss of chromosome 10 (+ 7/-10), EGFR amplification, duplication of the BRAF locus, and CDKN2A homozygous deletion. Results obtained by ddPCR were validated by other methods, including immunohistochemistry, Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing, microsatellite analyses for loss of heterozygosity, as well as real-time PCR- or microarray-based copy number assays. Particular strengths of the ddPCR approach are (1) its high analytical sensitivity allowing for reliable detection of mutations even with low mutant allele frequencies, (2) its quantitative determination of mutant allele frequencies and copy number changes, and (3) its rapid generation of results within a single day. Thus, in line with other recent studies our findings support ddPCR analysis as a valuable approach for molecular glioma diagnostics in a fast, quantitative and highly sensitive manner.},

	n2 = {Digital PCR (dPCR) is a highly accurate and precise technique for the quantification of target nucleic acid(s) in a biological sample. This digital quantification relies on the binomial or Poisson distribution to estimate the amount of target molecules based on positive and negative partitions. However, the implementation of these distributions require adherence to underlying assumptions that are often neglected, leading to a suboptimal (too optimistic) variance estimation of the target concentration, especially when considering the multiple sources of variation in experimental dPCR setups. Moreover, these parametric methods cannot be easily used for downstream statistical inference when more advanced analysis are required, such as for copy number variation.We evaluated the performance of three new statistical methods (BootsVar, NonPVar, BinomVar) in both simulations and real-life datasets for target and variance estimation in dPCR setups while taking into account a combination of commonly observed sources of experimental variability that can interfere with the underlying assumptions of the current parametric methods.The results demonstrate the capability of the new methods for variance estimation and present a more accurate reflection of the true variability over the classical binomial approach. In addition, these statistical methods are flexible and generic in the way that they work well for the variance estimation of non-linear statistics that work with ratios (e.g. CNV) and for multiplex dPCR setups.In this study, we provide guidelines when to use the binomial-assumption based methods and when the non-parametric one is better to achieve more accurate variance estimates.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Consequently, dPCR has the potential to have a substantial impact on research as well as diagnostic applications. However, as with qPCR, the ability to perform robust meaningful experiments requires careful design and adequate controls. To assist independent evaluation of experimental data, comprehensive disclosure of all relevant experimental details is required. To facilitate this process we present the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Digital PCR Experiments guidelines.

A challenge associated with digital PCR experiments, when testing unknown samples, is to perform experiments at dilutions allowing the detection of one or more targets of interest at a desired level of precision. While theory states that optimal precision (Po) is achieved by targeting \~{}1.59 mean copies per partition (λ), and that dynamic range (R) includes the space spanning one positive (λL) to one negative (λU) result from the total number of partitions (n), these results are tempered for the practitioner seeking to construct digital PCR experiments in the laboratory. A mathematical framework is presented elucidating the relationships between precision, dynamic range, number of partitions, interrogated volume, and sensitivity in digital PCR. The impact that false reaction calls and volumetric variation have on sensitivity and precision is next considered. The resultant effects on sensitivity and precision are established via Monte Carlo simulations reflecting the real-world likelihood of encountering such scenarios in the laboratory. The simulations provide insight to the practitioner on how to adapt experimental loading concentrations to counteract any one of these conditions. The framework is augmented with a method of extending the dynamic range of digital PCR, with and without increasing n, via the use of dilutions. An example experiment demonstrating the capabilities of the framework is presented enabling detection across 3.33 logs of starting copy concentration.},

	abstract = {The precision of compartment-based quantification methods is subject to multiple effects, of which partitioning and subsampling play a major role. Partitioning is the process of aliquoting the sample liquid and consequently the contained target molecules, whereas subsampling denotes the fact that usually only a portion of a sample is analyzed. In this work, we present a detailed statistical description comprising the effects of partitioning and subsampling on the relative uncertainty of the test result. We show that the state-of-the-art binomial model does not provide accurate results for the level of subsampling present when analyzing the nucleic acid content of single specific cells. Hence, in this work we address partitioning and subsampling effects separately and subsequently combine them to derive the relative uncertainty of a test system and compare it for single cell content analysis and body fluid analysis. In point-of-care test systems the area for partitioning and detection is usually limited, which means that a trade-off between the number of partitions (related to a partitioning uncertainty) and the amount of analyzed volume (related to a subsampling uncertainty) might be inevitable. In case of low target concentration, the subsampling uncertainty is dominant whereas for high target concentration, the partitioning uncertainty increases, and a larger number of partitions is beneficial to minimize the combined uncertainty. We show, that by minimizing the subsampling uncertainty in the test system, the quantification uncertainty of low target concentrations in single cell content analysis is much smaller than in body fluid analysis. In summary, the work provides the methodological basis for a profound statistical evaluation of partitioning and subsampling effects in compartment-based quantification methods and paves the way towards an improved design of future digital quantification devices for highly accurate molecular diagnostic analysis at the point-of-care.},

	abstract = {Digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) is a unique approach to measurement of the absolute copy number of target DNA without using external standards. However, the comparability of different dPCR platforms with respect to measurement of DNA copy number must be addressed before dPCR can be classified fundamentally as an absolute quantification technique. The comparability of four dPCR platforms with respect to accuracy and measurement uncertainty was investigated by using a certified plasmid reference material. Plasmid conformation was found to have a significant effect on droplet-based dPCR (QX100 and RainDrop) not shared with chip-based QuantStudio 12k or BioMark. The relative uncertainty of partition volume was determined to be 0.7%, 0.8%, 2.3% and 2.9% for BioMark, QX100, QuantStudio 12k and RainDrop, respectively. The measurements of the certified pNIM-001 plasmid made using the four dPCR platforms were corrected for partition volume and closely consistent with the certified value within the expended uncertainty. This demonstrated that the four dPCR platforms are of comparable effectiveness in quantifying DNA copy number. These findings provide an independent assessment of this method of determining DNA copy number when using different dPCR platforms and underline important factors that should be taken into consideration in the design of dPCR experiments.},

@article{ddPCR_ENGL:2019aa,
	abstract = {The digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (dPCR), for the detection and absolute quantification of DNA, is a relatively new technique but its application in analytical laboratories is steadily increasing. In contrast to quantitative real-time PCR, DNA (fragments) can be quantified without the need for standard curves. Using dPCR, the PCR mix containing the (target) DNA is partitioned -- depending on the device used -- currently into a maximum of 10,000,000 small compartments with a volume as low as a few picoliters. These can be either physically distinct compartments on a chip (referred to as chamber-based digital PCR [cdPCR]), or these compartments correspond to water-in-oil droplets (referred to as droplet digital [ddPCR]). Common to both approaches, once PCR has been carried out simultaneously in all compartments/droplets, the number of positive and negative signals for each partition is counted by fluorescence measurement. 
		With this technique, an absolute quantification of DNA copy numbers can be performed with high precision and trueness, even for very low DNA copy numbers. Furthermore, dPCR is considered less susceptible than qPCR to PCR inhibitory substances that can be co-extracted during DNA extraction from different sources.
		Digital PCR has already been applied in various fields, for example for the detection and quantification of GMOs, species (animals, plants), human diseases, food viruses and bacteria including pathogens.
		When establishing dPCR in a laboratory, different aspects have to be considered. These include, but are not limited to, the adjustment of the type of the PCR master mix used, optimised primer and probe concentrations and signal separation of positive and negative compartments. This document addresses these and other aspects and provides recommendations for the transfer of existing real-time PCR methods into a dPCR format.

	abstract = {The classical Poisson, geometric and negative binomial regression models for count data belong to the family of generalized linear models and are available at the core of the statistics toolbox in the R system for statistical computing. After reviewing the conceptual and computational features of these methods, a new implementation of hurdle and zero-inflated regression models in the functions {$<$}code{$>$}hurdle(){$<$}/code{$>$} and {$<$}code{$>$}zeroinfl(){$<$}/code{$>$} from the package {$<$}b{$>$}pscl{$<$}/b{$>$} is introduced. It re-uses design and functionality of the basic R functions just as the underlying conceptual tools extend the classical models. Both hurdle and zero-inflated model, are able to incorporate over-dispersion and excess zeros-two problems that typically occur in count data sets in economics and the social sciences-better than their classical counterparts. Using cross-section data on the demand for medical care, it is illustrated how the classical as well as the zero-augmented models can be fitted, inspected and tested in practice.},

PCR solution is distributed throughout numerous partitions, and following amplification, target DNA copy number is estimated based on the proportion of partitions containing amplified DNA. Here, we identify approaches for obtaining reliable digital PCR data. Single molecule amplification efficiency was significantly improved following fragmentation of total DNA and bias in copy number estimates reduced by analysis of short intact target DNA fragments. Random and independent distribution of target DNA molecules throughout partitions, which is critical to accurate digital PCR measurement, was demonstrated by spatial distribution analysis. The estimated relative uncertainty for target DNA concentration was under 6{\%} when analyzing five digital panels comprising 765 partitions each, provided the panels contained an average of 212 to 3,365 template molecules. Partition volume was a major component of this uncertainty estimate. These findings can be applied to other digital PCR studies to improve confidence in such measurements.},

However, in the validation of qualitative methods it is not clear how to characterize a method's reproducibility. One approach for determining a qualitative method's reproducibility is presented for microbiological methods, where the distribution of colony forming units (CFU) follows a Poisson distribution. The method's reproducibility is defined in terms of the variability of the limit of detection (LOD) values. For a better estimation of reproducibility precision, our proposed approach is using an orthogonal factorial plan. Since an exact determination of absolute contamination levels is often not possible, following the ISO 16140-2:2016 {$[$}Microbiology of food and animal feed---method validation---part 2: protocol for the validation of alternative (proprietary) methods against a reference method, 2016{$]$}, an approach is proposed which is based on the ratio of the LOD values of a reference and an alternative method.

However, little information is available how to statistically compare dPCR runs of multiple runs or reduplicates. The comparison of λ values from several runs is a multiple comparison problem, which can be solved using the binary structure of dPCR data. We propose and evaluate two novel methods based on Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Multiple Ratio Tests (MRT) for comparison of digital PCR experiments. We enriched our MRT framework with computation of simultaneous confidence intervals suitable for comparing multiple dPCR runs. The evaluation of both statistical methods support that MRT is faster and more robust for dPCR experiments performed in large scale. Our theoretical results were confirmed by the analysis of dPCR measurements of dilution series. Both methods were implemented in the dpcR package (v. 0.2) for the open source R statistical computing environment.},

This requirement has two unfavorable consequences. First, large amounts of sample-typically micrograms-are needed for library preparation, thereby limiting the scope of samples which can be sequenced. For many applications, including metagenomics and the sequencing of ancient, forensic, and clinical samples, the quantity of input DNA can be critically limiting. Second, each library requires a titration sequencing run, thereby increasing the cost and lowering the throughput of sequencing.},

@article{Kreutz:2011aa,
	abstract = {This paper presents a protocol using theoretical methods and free software to design and analyze multivolume digital PCR (MV digital PCR) devices; the theory and software are also applicable to design and analysis of dilution series in digital PCR. MV digital PCR minimizes the total number of wells required for "digital" (single molecule) measurements while maintaining high dynamic range and high resolution. In some examples, multivolume designs with fewer than 200 total wells are predicted to provide dynamic range with 5-fold resolution similar to that of single-volume designs requiring 12,000 wells. Mathematical techniques were utilized and expanded to maximize the information obtained from each experiment and to quantify performance of devices and were experimentally validated using the SlipChip platform. MV digital PCR was demonstrated to perform reliably, and results from wells of different volumes agreed with one another. No artifacts due to different surface-to-volume ratios were observed, and single molecule amplification in volumes ranging from 1 to 125 nL was self-consistent. The device presented here was designed to meet the testing requirements for measuring clinically relevant levels of HIV viral load at the point-of-care (in plasma, <500 molecules/mL to >1,000,000 molecules/mL), and the predicted resolution and dynamic range was experimentally validated using a control sequence of DNA. This approach simplifies digital PCR experiments, saves space, and thus enables multiplexing using separate areas for each sample on one chip, and facilitates the development of new high-performance diagnostic tools for resource-limited applications. The theory and software presented here are general and are applicable to designing and analyzing other digital analytical platforms including digital immunoassays and digital bacterial analysis. It is not limited to SlipChip and could also be useful for the design of systems on platforms including valve-based and droplet-based platforms. In a separate publication by Shen et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2011, DOI: 10.1021/ja2060116), this approach is used to design and test digital RT-PCR devices for quantifying RNA.},

	abstract = {Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a new technology that was recently commercialized to enable the precise quantification of target nucleic acids in a sample. ddPCR measures absolute quantities by counting nucleic acid molecules encapsulated in discrete, volumetrically defined, water-in-oil droplet partitions. This novel ddPCR format offers a simple workflow capable of generating highly stable partitioning of DNA molecules. In this study, we assessed key performance parameters of the ddPCR system. A linear ddPCR response to DNA concentration was obtained from 0.16% through to 99.6% saturation in a 20,000 droplet assay corresponding to more than 4 orders of magnitude of target DNA copy number per ddPCR. Analysis of simplex and duplex assays targeting two distinct loci in the Lambda DNA genome using the ddPCR platform agreed, within their expanded uncertainties, with values obtained using a lower density microfluidic chamber based digital PCR (cdPCR). A relative expanded uncertainty under 5% was achieved for copy number concentration using ddPCR. This level of uncertainty is much lower than values typically observed for quantification of specific DNA target sequences using currently commercially available real-time and digital cdPCR technologies.},

@article{Whale:2013aa,
	abstract = {Digital PCR (dPCR) is a highly accurate molecular approach, capable of precise measurements, offering a number of unique opportunities. However, in its current format dPCR can be limited by the amount of sample that can be analysed and consequently additional considerations such as performing multiplex reactions or pre-amplification can be considered. This study investigated the impact of duplexing and pre-amplification on dPCR analysis by using three different assays targeting a model template (a portion of the Arabidopsis thaliana alcohol dehydrogenase gene). We also investigated the impact of different template types (linearised plasmid clone and more complex genomic DNA) on measurement precision using dPCR. We were able to demonstrate that duplex dPCR can provide a more precise measurement than uniplex dPCR, while applying pre-amplification or varying template type can significantly decrease the precision of dPCR. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the pre-amplification step can introduce measurement bias that is not consistent between experiments for a sample or assay and so could not be compensated for during the analysis of this data set. We also describe a model for estimating the prevalence of molecular dropout and identify this as a source of dPCR imprecision. Our data have demonstrated that the precision afforded by dPCR at low sample concentration can exceed that of the same template post pre-amplification thereby negating the need for this additional step. Our findings also highlight the technical differences between different templates types containing the same sequence that must be considered if plasmid DNA is to be used to assess or control for more complex templates like genomic DNA.},

	abstract = {Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a novel platform for exact quantification of DNA which holds great promise in clinical diagnostics. It is increasingly popular due to its digital nature, which provides more accurate quantification and higher sensitivity than traditional real-time PCR. However, clinical adoption has been slowed in part by the lack of software tools available for analyzing ddPCR data. Here, we present ddpcr - a new R package for ddPCR visualization and analysis. In addition, ddpcr includes a web application (powered by the Shiny R package) that allows users to analyze ddPCR data using an interactive graphical interface.},

@article{Quan:2018aa,
	abstract = {Digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (dPCR) is a novel method for the absolute quantification of target nucleic acids. Quantification by dPCR hinges on the fact that the random distribution of molecules in many partitions follows a Poisson distribution. Each partition acts as an individual PCR microreactor and partitions containing amplified target sequences are detected by fluorescence. The proportion of PCR-positive partitions suffices to determine the concentration of the target sequence without a need for calibration. Advances in microfluidics enabled the current revolution of digital quantification by providing efficient partitioning methods. In this review, we compare the fundamental concepts behind the quantification of nucleic acids by dPCR and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). We detail the underlying statistics of dPCR and explain how it defines its precision and performance metrics. We review the different microfluidic digital PCR formats, present their underlying physical principles, and analyze the technological evolution of dPCR platforms. We present the novel multiplexing strategies enabled by dPCR and examine how isothermal amplification could be an alternative to PCR in digital assays. Finally, we determine whether the theoretical advantages of dPCR over qPCR hold true by perusing studies that directly compare assays implemented with both methods.},

	abstract = {A digital assay is one in which the sample is partitioned into many small containers such that each partition contains a discrete number of biological entities (0, 1, 2, 3, {\ldots}). A powerful technique in the biologist's toolkit, digital assays bring a new level of precision in quantifying nucleic acids, measuring proteins and their enzymatic activity, and probing single-cell genotypes and phenotypes. Part I of this review begins with the benefits and Poisson statistics of partitioning, including sources of error. The remainder focuses on digital PCR (dPCR) for quantification of nucleic acids. We discuss five commercial instruments that partition samples into physically isolated chambers (cdPCR) or droplet emulsions (ddPCR). We compare the strengths of dPCR (absolute quantitation, precision, and ability to detect rare or mutant targets) with those of its predecessor, quantitative real-time PCR (dynamic range, larger sample volumes, and throughput). Lastly, we describe several promising applications of dPCR, including copy number variation, quantitation of circulating tumor DNA and viral load, RNA/miRNA quantitation with reverse transcription dPCR, and library preparation for next-generation sequencing. This review is intended to give a broad perspective to scientists interested in adopting digital assays into their workflows. Part II focuses on digital protein and cell assays. デジタルアッセイ パート1：パーティショニングの統計とデジタルPCR デジタルアッセイとはサンプルを多数の微細なコンテナに分配し、各パーティションに個々の数（0、1、2、3{\ldots}）の生物学的実体が含まれるようにする方法である。生物学者用ツールキットの有力な手段であるデジタルアッセイは、核酸の定量、種々のタンパク質とそれらの酵素活性の測定、および単細胞由来の遺伝子型と表現型の探索の精度を新たなレベルに引き上げる。本レビューのパート1では始めに、パーティショニングのベネフィットおよびエラーの発生源を含めたPoisson分布の統計処理について述べる。次に核酸を定量するデジタルPCR（dPCR）に注目する。サンプルを物理的に隔離されたチャンバー（cdPCR）またはエマルジョン化したドロップレット（ddPCR）内に分配する5種類の市販ツールについて述べる。dPCRの長所（絶対定量、高精度、希少ターゲットまたは変異ターゲットの検出力）を、従来のPCR、すなわちリアルタイム定量PCRの長所（ダイナミックレンジ、多サンプル量、およびハイスループット）と比較する。最後に、将来有望ないくつかのdPCRの応用について述べる、例えば、コピー数多型の解析、循環腫瘍DNAおよびウイルス負荷の定量、逆転写反応dPCRによるRNA/miRNAの定量、および次世代シーケンシングのためのライブラリの作成などである。本レビューの目的は、デジタルアッセイを自身のワークフローに採用することに関心のある科学者に、幅広い展望を示すことである。パート2ではタンパク質と細胞のデジタルアッセイに注目する。 数字测定第一部分：分区统计和数字PCR 数字测定表示将样本分别装入众多小容器中，以便每个分区包含不同数量的生物实体（0、1、2、3{\ldots}{\ldots}）。作为生物学家工具包中一项功能出色的技术，数字测定可以全面提升核酸定量、蛋白质及其酶活性测量以及单细胞基因型和显性检测的精度。本文第一部分将介绍分区的优势和泊松统计，包括误差源。第二部分将关注用于定量核酸的数字PCR（dPCR）。我们将讨论5种用于将样本分割为物理隔离室（cdPCR）或滴乳液（ddPCR）的仪器，并就dPCR（绝对定量、精度、能够探测罕见或突变目标）与之前采用的实时定量PCR（动态范围、更大的采样量和更高的效率）的优劣进行比较。最后，我们将介绍dPCR的数种潜在应用，包括拷贝数变异、定量循环肿瘤DNA和病毒量、应用逆转录dPCR的RNA/miRNA定量以及制备库以用于新一代排序。本文旨在为有意引入数字测定的科学家提供全面的介绍。第二部分关注数字蛋白质和细胞测定。 数字测定第一部分：分区统计和数字PCR 数字测定表示将样本分别装入众多小容器中，以便每个分区包含不同数量的生物实体（0、1、2、3{\ldots}{\ldots}）。作为生物学家工具包中一项功能出色的技术，数字测定可以全面提升核酸定量、蛋白质及其酶活性测量以及单细胞基因型和显性检测的精度。本文第一部分将介绍分区的优势和泊松统计，包括误差源。第二部分将关注用于定量核酸的数字PCR（dPCR）。我们将讨论5种用于将样本分割为物理隔离室（cdPCR）或滴乳液（ddPCR）的仪器，并就dPCR（绝对定量、精度、能够探测罕见或突变目标）与之前采用的实时定量PCR（动态范围、更大的采样量和更高的效率）的优劣进行比较。最后，我们将介绍dPCR的数种潜在应用，包括拷贝数变异、定量循环肿瘤DNA和病毒量、应用逆转录dPCR的RNA/miRNA定量以及制备库以用于新一代排序。本文旨在为有意引入数字测定的科学家提供全面的介绍。第二部分关注数字蛋白质和细胞测定。},

A powerful technique in the biologist's toolkit, digital assays bring a new level of precision in quantifying nucleic acids, measuring proteins and their enzymatic activity, and probing single-cell genotype and phenotype. Where part I of this review focused on the fundamentals of partitioning and digital PCR, part II turns its attention to digital protein and cell assays. Digital enzyme assays measure the kinetics of single proteins with enzymatic activity. Digital enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs) quantify antigenic proteins with 2 to 3 log lower detection limit than conventional ELISA, making them well suited for low-abundance biomarkers. Digital cell assays probe single-cell genotype and phenotype, including gene expression, intracellular and surface proteins, metabolic activity, cytotoxicity, and transcriptomes (scRNA-seq). These methods exploit partitioning to 1) isolate single cells or proteins, 2) detect their activity via enzymatic amplification, and 3) tag them individually by coencapsulating them with molecular barcodes. When scaled, digital assays reveal stochastic differences between proteins or cells within a population, a key to understanding biological heterogeneity. This review is intended to give a broad perspective to scientists interested in adopting digital assays into their workflows. デジタルアッセイ パート2：タンパク質と細胞のデジタルアッセイ デジタルアッセイとはサンプルを多数の微細なコンテナに分配し、各パーティションに個々の数（0、1、2、3{\ldots}）の生物学的実体が含まれるようにする方法である。生物学者用ツールキットの有力な手段であるデジタルアッセイは、核酸の定量、種々のタンパク質とそれらの酵素活性の測定、および単細胞由来の遺伝子型および表現型の探索の精度を新たなレベルに引き上げる。本レビューのパート1ではパーティショニングとデジタルPCRの基本に重点を置いているが、パート2ではタンパク質と細胞のデジタルアッセイに注目する。酵素デジタルアッセイは酵素活性により単一タンパク質の動態を定量化し測定する。デジタル酵素結合免疫測定法（デジタルELISA法）はタンパク質の定量において従来のELISA法より検出下限が2～3log低いためするため、低含量のバイオマーカーに適切である。細胞デジタルアッセイは単細胞由来の遺伝子型と表現型について、例えば遺伝子発現、細胞間および細胞表面のタンパク質、代謝活性、細胞傷害性、およびトランスクリプトーム（scRNA-SEQ）などを探索する。これらの方法はパーティショニングを活用して、酵素増幅を通じて分子を検出し、単細胞活性を隔離し、単細胞のトレーサビリティを確保する。スケールを調整するとデジタルアッセイは、ある母集団内のタンパク質または細胞間の推計学的差、すなわち生物学的不均一性を理解する鍵となる推計学的差を明らかにする。本レビューの目的は、デジタルアッセイを自身のワークフローに採用することに関心のある科学者に、幅広い展望を示すことである。 数字测定第二部分：数字蛋白质和细胞测定 数字测定表示将样本分别装入众多容器中，以便每个分区包含不同数量的生物实体（0、1、2、3{\ldots}{\ldots}）。作为生物学家工具包中一项功能出色的技术，数字测定可以全面提升核酸定量、蛋白质及其酶活性测量以及单细胞基因型和表现型检测的精度。本文第一部分重点介绍了分区和数字PCR的基础知识，第二部分将关注数字蛋白质和细胞测定。数字酶测定可以定量和测量单一蛋白质与酶活性的动力学。相比传统ELISA方法，数字酶联免疫测定（ELISA）可以定量具有2-3个更低检测限制的蛋白质，非常适合低丰度生物标志物。数字细胞测定可以检测单细胞基因型和表现型，包括基因表达、细胞内和表面蛋白质、代谢活动、细胞毒性和转录物组（scRNA-SEQ）。这些方法能够探索分区以并通过酶扩增检测分子、隔离单细胞活动并提供单细胞溯源性的可能。分区后，数字测定可以显示群体中蛋白质或细胞的随机差异，这是理解生物异质性的关键。本文旨在为有意引入数字测定的科学家提供全面的介绍。 数字测定第二部分：数字蛋白质和细胞测定 数字测定表示将样本分别装入众多容器中，以便每个分区包含不同数量的生物实体（0、1、2、3{\ldots}{\ldots}）。作为生物学家工具包中一项功能出色的技术，数字测定可以全面提升核酸定量、蛋白质及其酶活性测量以及单细胞基因型和表现型检测的精度。本文第一部分重点介绍了分区和数字PCR的基础知识，第二部分将关注数字蛋白质和细胞测定。数字酶测定可以定量和测量单一蛋白质与酶活性的动力学。相比传统ELISA方法，数字酶联免疫测定（ELISA）可以定量具有2-3个更低检测限制的蛋白质，非常适合低丰度生物标志物。数字细胞测定可以检测单细胞基因型和表现型，包括基因表达、细胞内和表面蛋白质、代谢活动、细胞毒性和转录物组（scRNA-SEQ）。这些方法能够探索分区以并通过酶扩增检测分子、隔离单细胞活动并提供单细胞溯源性的可能。分区后，数字测定可以显示群体中蛋白质或细胞的随机差异，这是理解生物异质性的关键。本文旨在为有意引入数字测定的科学家提供全面的介绍。},

	abstract = {Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is an emerging technology for quantifying DNA. By partitioning the target DNA into ∼20 000 droplets, each serving as its own PCR reaction compartment, a very high sensitivity of DNA quantification can be achieved. However, manual analysis of the data is time consuming and algorithms for automated analysis of non-orthogonal, multiplexed ddPCR data are unavailable, presenting a major bottleneck for the advancement of ddPCR transitioning from low-throughput to high-throughput.ddPCRclust is an R package for automated analysis of data from Bio-Rad's droplet digital PCR systems (QX100 and QX200). It can automatically analyze and visualize multiplexed ddPCR experiments with up to four targets per reaction. Results are on par with manual analysis, but only take minutes to compute instead of hours. The accompanying Shiny app ddPCRvis provides easy access to the functionalities of ddPCRclust through a web-browser based GUI.R package: https://github.com/bgbrink/ddPCRclust; Interface: https://github.com/bgbrink/ddPCRvis/; Web: https://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/ddPCRvis/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{Taylor:2017aa,
	abstract = {Quantitative PCR (qPCR) has become the gold standard technique to measure cDNA and gDNA levels but the resulting data can be highly variable, artifactual and non-reproducible without appropriate verification and validation of both samples and primers. The root cause of poor quality data is typically associated with inadequate dilution of residual protein and chemical contaminants that variably inhibit Taq polymerase and primer annealing. The most susceptible, frustrating and often most interesting samples are those containing low abundant targets with small expression differences of 2-fold or lower. Here, Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) and qPCR platforms were directly compared for gene expression analysis using low amounts of purified, synthetic DNA in well characterized samples under identical reaction conditions. We conclude that for sample/target combinations with low levels of nucleic acids (Cq ≥29) and/or variable amounts of chemical and protein contaminants, ddPCR technology will produce more precise, reproducible and statistically significant results required for publication quality data. A stepwise methodology is also described to choose between these complimentary technologies to obtain the best results for any experiment.},
