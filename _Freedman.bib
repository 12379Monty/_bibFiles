@article{Freedman:2008ad,
	abstract = {Regression adjustments are often made to experimental data. Since randomization does not justify the models, almost anything can happen. Here, we evaluate results using Neyman's non-parametric model, where each subject has two potential responses, one if treated and the other if untreated. Only one of the two responses is observed. Regression estimates are generally biased, but the bias is small with large samples. Adjustment may improve precision, or make precision worse; standard errors computed according to usual procedures may overstate the precision, or understate, by quite large factors. Asymptotic expansions make these ideas more precise.},

@article{Freedman:1999ab,
	abstract = {Epidemiologic methods were developed to prove general causation: identifying exposures that increase the risk of particular diseases. Courts often are more interested in specific causation: On balance of probabilities, was the plaintiff's disease caused by exposure to the agent in question? Some authorities have suggested that a relative risk greater than 2.0 meets the standard of proof for specific causation. Such a definite criterion is appealing, but there are difficulties. Bias and confounding are familiar problems; individual differences must be considered too. The issues are explored in the context of the swine flu vaccine and Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome. THE CONCLUSION: There is a considerable gap between relative risks and proof of specific causation.},

@article{Freedman:1991aa,
	abstract = {{$[$}Regression models have been used in the social sciences at least since 1899, when Yule published a paper on the causes of pauperism. Regression models are now used to make causal arguments in a wide variety of applications, and it is perhaps time to evaluate the results. No definitive answers can be given, but this paper takes a rather negative view. Snow's work on cholera is presented as a success story for scientific reasoning based on nonexperimental data. Failure stories are also discussed, and comparisons may provide some insight. In particular, this paper suggests that statistical technique can seldom be an adequate substitute for good design, relevant data, and testing predictions against reality in a variety of settings.{$]$}},

	abstract = {Abstract. One type of scientific inquiry involves the analysis of large data sets, often using statistical models and formal tests of hypotheses. Large observational studies have, for example, led to important progress in health science. However, in fields ranging from epidemiology to political science, other types of scientific inquiry are also productive. Informal reasoning, qualitative insights, and the creation of novel data sets that require deep substantive knowledge and a great expenditure of effort and shoe leather have pivotal roles. Many breakthroughs came from recognizing anomalies and capitalizing on accidents, which require immersion in the subject. Progress means refuting old ideas if they are wrong, developing new ideas that are better, and testing both. Qualitative insights can play a key role in all three tasks. Combining the qualitative and the quantitative--and a healthy dose of skepticism--may provide the most secure results.One type of scientific inquiry involves the analysis of large data sets, often using statistical models and formal tests of hypotheses. A moment's thought, however, shows that there must be other types of scientific inquiry. For instance, something has to be done to answer questions like the following. How should a study be designed? What sorts of data should be collected? What kind of a model is needed? Which hypotheses should be formulated in terms of the model and then tested against the data?},
