	Abstract = {The Nanostring nCounter gene expression assay uses molecular barcodes and single molecule imaging to detect and count hundreds of unique transcripts in a single reaction. These counts need to be normalized to adjust for the amount of sample, variations in assay efficiency and other factors. Most users adopt the normalization approach described in the nSolver analysis software, which involves background correction based on the observed values of negative control probes, a within-sample normalization using the observed values of positive control probes and normalization across samples using reference (housekeeping) genes. Here we present a new normalization method, Removing Unwanted Variation-III (RUV-III), which makes vital use of technical replicates and suitable control genes. We also propose an approach using pseudo-replicates when technical replicates are not available. The effectiveness of RUV-III is illustrated on four different datasets. We also offer suggestions on the design and analysis of studies involving this technology.},

@article{Li:2018aa,
	Abstract = {Breast cancer (BC) is increasing in incidence and resistance to treatment worldwide. The challenges in limited therapeutic options and poor survival outcomes in BC subtypes persist because of its molecular heterogeneity and resistance to standard endocrine therapy. Recently, high throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been used to identify biomarkers of disease progression and signaling pathways that could be amenable to specific therapies according to the BC subtype. However, there is no single generally accepted pipeline for the analysis of RNA-seq data in biomarker discovery due, in part, to the needs of simultaneously satisfying constraints of sensitivity and specificity. We proposed a combined approach using gene-wise normalization, UQ-pgQ2, followed by a Wald test from DESeq2. Our approach improved the analysis based on within-group comparisons in terms of the specificity when applied to publicly available RNA-seq BC datasets. In terms of identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we combined an optimized log2 fold change cutoff with a nominal false discovery rate of 0.05 to further minimize false positives. Using this method in the analysis of two GEO BC datasets, we identified 797 DEGs uniquely expressed in triple negative BC (TNBC) and significantly associated with T cell and immune-related signaling, contributing to the immunotherapeutic efficacy in TNBC patients. In contrast, we identified 1403 DEGs uniquely expressed in estrogen positive and HER2 negative BC (ER+HER2-BC) and significantly associated with eicosanoid, notching and FAK signaling while a common set of genes was associated with cellular growth and proliferation. Thus, our approach to control for false positives identified two distinct gene expression profiles associated with these two subtypes of BC which are distinguishable by their molecular and functional attributes.},

@article{Holloway:2006aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concerns are often raised about the accuracy of microarray technologies and the degree of cross-platform agreement, but there are yet no methods which can unambiguously evaluate precision and sensitivity for these technologies on a whole-array basis. RESULTS: A methodology is described for evaluating the precision and sensitivity of whole-genome gene expression technologies such as microarrays. The method consists of an easy-to-construct titration series of RNA samples and an associated statistical analysis using non-linear regression. The method evaluates the precision and responsiveness of each microarray platform on a whole-array basis, i.e., using all the probes, without the need to match probes across platforms. An experiment is conducted to assess and compare four widely used microarray platforms. All four platforms are shown to have satisfactory precision but the commercial platforms are superior for resolving differential expression for genes at lower expression levels. The effective precision of the two-color platforms is improved by allowing for probe-specific dye-effects in the statistical model. The methodology is used to compare three data extraction algorithms for the Affymetrix platforms, demonstrating poor performance for the commonly used proprietary algorithm relative to the other algorithms. For probes which can be matched across platforms, the cross-platform variability is decomposed into within-platform and between-platform components, showing that platform disagreement is almost entirely systematic rather than due to measurement variability. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate good precision and sensitivity for all the platforms, but highlight the need for improved probe annotation. They quantify the extent to which cross-platform measures can be expected to be less accurate than within-platform comparisons for predicting disease progression or outcome.},

@article{Storey:2003aa,
	Abstract = {With the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace in biology. It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

	Abstract = {There is a critical need for standard approaches to assess, report and compare the technical performance of genome-scale differential gene expression experiments. Here we assess technical performance with a proposed standard 'dashboard' of metrics derived from analysis of external spike-in RNA control ratio mixtures. These control ratio mixtures with defined abundance ratios enable assessment of diagnostic performance of differentially expressed transcript lists, limit of detection of ratio (LODR) estimates and expression ratio variability and measurement bias. The performance metrics suite is applicable to analysis of a typical experiment, and here we also apply these metrics to evaluate technical performance among laboratories. An interlaboratory study using identical samples shared among 12 laboratories with three different measurement processes demonstrates generally consistent diagnostic power across 11 laboratories. Ratio measurement variability and bias are also comparable among laboratories for the same measurement process. We observe different biases for measurement processes using different mRNA-enrichment protocols.},

	Abstract = {Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome and has become the most common reason for adult hospitalization in developed countries. Two subtypes of heart failure, ischemic heart disease (ISCH) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), have been studied using microarray platforms. However, microarray has limited resolution. Here we applied RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify gene signatures for heart failure from six individuals, including three controls, one ISCH and two DCM patients. Using genes identified from this small RNA-Seq dataset, we were able to accurately classify heart failure status in a much larger set of 313 individuals. The identified genes significantly overlapped with genes identified via genome-wide association studies for cardiometabolic traits and the promoters of those genes were enriched for binding sites for transcriptions factors. Our results indicate that it is possible to use RNA-Seq to classify disease status for complex diseases such as heart failure using an extremely small training dataset.},

	Abstract = {The concordance of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) with microarrays for genome-wide analysis of differential gene expression has not been rigorously assessed using a range of chemical treatment conditions. Here we use a comprehensive study design to generate Illumina RNA-seq and Affymetrix microarray data from the same liver samples of rats exposed in triplicate to varying degrees of perturbation by 27 chemicals representing multiple modes of action (MOAs). The cross-platform concordance in terms of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or enriched pathways is linearly correlated with treatment effect size (R(2)0.8). Furthermore, the concordance is also affected by transcript abundance and biological complexity of the MOA. RNA-seq outperforms microarray (93{\%} versus 75{\%}) in DEG verification as assessed by quantitative PCR, with the gain mainly due to its improved accuracy for low-abundance transcripts. Nonetheless, classifiers to predict MOAs perform similarly when developed using data from either platform. Therefore, the endpoint studied and its biological complexity, transcript abundance and the genomic application are important factors in transcriptomic research and for clinical and regulatory decision making.},

@article{Zhao:2014aa,
	Abstract = {To demonstrate the benefits of RNA-Seq over microarray in transcriptome profiling, both RNA-Seq and microarray analyses were performed on RNA samples from a human T cell activation experiment. In contrast to other reports, our analyses focused on the difference, rather than similarity, between RNA-Seq and microarray technologies in transcriptome profiling. A comparison of data sets derived from RNA-Seq and Affymetrix platforms using the same set of samples showed a high correlation between gene expression profiles generated by the two platforms. However, it also demonstrated that RNA-Seq was superior in detecting low abundance transcripts, differentiating biologically critical isoforms, and allowing the identification of genetic variants. RNA-Seq also demonstrated a broader dynamic range than microarray, which allowed for the detection of more differentially expressed genes with higher fold-change. Analysis of the two datasets also showed the benefit derived from avoidance of technical issues inherent to microarray probe performance such as cross-hybridization, non-specific hybridization and limited detection range of individual probes. Because RNA-Seq does not rely on a pre-designed complement sequence detection probe, it is devoid of issues associated with probe redundancy and annotation, which simplified interpretation of the data. Despite the superior benefits of RNA-Seq, microarrays are still the more common choice of researchers when conducting transcriptional profiling experiments. This is likely because RNA-Seq sequencing technology is new to most researchers, more expensive than microarray, data storage is more challenging and analysis is more complex. We expect that once these barriers are overcome, the RNA-Seq platform will become the predominant tool for transcriptome analysis.},

@article{Kelly:2018aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer chemotherapy-associated febrile neutropenia (FN) is a common condition that is deadly when bacteremia is present. Detection of bacteremia depends on culture, which takes days, and no accurate predictive tools applicable to the initial evaluation are available. We utilized metabolomics and transcriptomics to develop multivariable predictors of bacteremia among FN patients. METHODS: We classified emergency department patients with FN and no apparent infection at presentation as bacteremic (cases) or not (controls), according to blood culture results. We assessed relative metabolite abundance in plasma, and relative expression of 2,560 immunology and cancer-related genes in whole blood. We used logistic regression to identify multivariable predictors of bacteremia, and report test characteristics of the derived predictors. RESULTS: For metabolomics, 14 bacteremic cases and 25 non-bacteremic controls were available for analysis; for transcriptomics we had 7 and 22 respectively. A 5-predictor metabolomic model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.991 (95{\%}CI: 0.972,1.000), 100{\%} sensitivity, and 96{\%} specificity for identifying bacteremia. Pregnenolone steroids were more abundant in cases and carnitine metabolites were more abundant in controls. A 3-predictor gene expression model had corresponding results of 0.961 (95{\%}CI: 0.896,1.000), 100{\%}, and 86{\%}. Genes involved in innate immunity were differentially expressed. CONCLUSIONS: Classifiers derived from metabolomic and gene expression data hold promise as objective and accurate predictors of bacteremia among FN patients without apparent infection at presentation, and can provide insights into the underlying biology. Our findings should be considered illustrative, but may lay the groundwork for future biomarker development.},

Several platforms for measurement of extracellular RNAs have recently become available. We evaluated the reproducibility, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of four miRNA quantification platforms, including one widely used discovery approach (small RNA-seq) and three targeted platforms (FirePlex, EdgeSeq, and nCounter). Using pools of synthetic miRNAs, we observed that reproducibility was highest for RNA-seq and EdgeSeq, that all three targeted platforms had lower bias than RNA-seq, and that RNA-seq had the best ability to distinguish between present and absent sequences. Overall reproducibility was lower for plasma samples than synthetic miRNA pools. We compared expression of placental miRNAs in plasma from pregnant and non-pregnant women and observed expected differences with RNA-seq and EdgeSeq, but not FirePlex or nCounter. We conclude that differences in performance among miRNA profiling platforms impact their relative utility as potential assay systems for clinical biomarkers.},

	Abstract = {Purpose: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with an immunosuppressive milieu that supports immune system evasion and disease progression. Here, we interrogated genetic, stromal, and immunologic features of PDAC to delineate impact on prognosis and means to more effectively employ immunotherapy.Experimental Design: A cohort of 109 PDAC cases annotated for overall survival was utilized as a primary discovery cohort. Gene expression analysis defined immunologic subtypes of PDAC that were confirmed in the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. Stromal and metabolic characteristics of PDAC cases were evaluated by histologic analysis and immunostaining. Enumeration of lymphocytes, as well as staining for CD8, FOXP3, CD68, CD163, PDL1, and CTLA4 characterized immune infiltrate. Neoantigens were determined by analysis of whole-exome sequencing data. Random-forest clustering was employed to define multimarker subtypes, with univariate and multivariate analyses interrogating prognostic significance.Results: PDAC cases exhibited distinct stromal phenotypes that were associated with prognosis, glycolytic and hypoxic biomarkers, and immune infiltrate composition. Immune infiltrate was diverse among PDAC cases and enrichment for M2 macrophages and select immune checkpoints regulators were specifically associated with survival. Composite analysis with neoantigen burden, immunologic, and stromal features defined novel subtypes of PDAC that could have bearing on sensitivity to immunologic therapy approaches. In addition, a subtype with low levels of neoantigens and minimal lymphocyte infiltrate was associated with improved overall survival.Conclusions: The mutational burden of PDAC is associated with distinct immunosuppressive mechanisms that are conditioned by the tumor stromal environment. The defined subtypes have significance for utilizing immunotherapy in the treatment of PDAC. Clin Cancer Res; 23(15); 4429-40. {\copyright}2017 AACR.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) is a rare, highly aggressive cancer. It is often difficult to determine whether SNUC is a distinct pathologic entity with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine features or it represents an undifferentiated tumor of squamous lineage. Also, reliable histopathologic markers that distinguish SNUC from poorly differentiated sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SNSCC) are lacking. Therefore, identification of new diagnostic molecular markers for SNUC is needed. METHODS: Treatment-na{\"\i}ve tumor specimens obtained from 15 SNUC and 6 SNSCC patients were used. Gene expression analysis was performed using an oncology panel. RESULTS: An unsupervised cluster analysis divided the patients into the one with only SNUCs and the one with mainly SNSCCs. Of 132 differentially expressed genes, 7 genes completely distinguished SNUCs from SNSCCs. SNUCs were enriched in sets of genes related to DNA repair, synthesis/replication, and cell division. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified new diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic targets for SNUC.},

	Abstract = {Clinical biomarker studies are often hindered by the scarcity or suboptimal quality of biological specimens. EdgeSeq, a transcriptomics analysis platform, combines quantitative nuclease protection assay technology with next-generation sequencing, using small amounts of starting material and delivering reproducible gene expression profiles from challenging material, such as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. To evaluate EdgeSeq for analysis of archives of stained FFPE tissue, EdgeSeq was performed on unstained, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained, and immunohistochemistry-stained slides from patients with small-cell and non-small-cell lung cancer. Pairwise comparisons of gene expression profiles from stained and unstained slides showed higher Pearson correlation coefficients with H&E staining (0.86 to 0.97) than with immunohistochemistry staining (0.21 to 0.56). A 25-gene interferon-γ signature score from unstained slides showed a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.92 with H&E-stained slides and a significant Spearman correlation (P = 0.0025) with immune scores. To test gene expression profiling in small samples, FFPE sample equivalents were examined from 5.0 to 0.08 mm(2) of a section (5 μm thick); sample equivalents ≥0.31 mm(2) showed alignment rates >69% and pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients ≥0.87. EdgeSeq can, thus, be used to profile small and H&E-stained FFPE tumor specimens to obtain biomarker data from limited tissue in oncology clinical trials and enable research into tumor microenvironment and immune cell engagement with tumors at the locoregional level.},

	Abstract = {AIM: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) clinical tissue samples have the potential to provide valuable gene-expression data for the development of cancer biomarkers. However, FFPE RNA is extensively fragmented, presenting a significant challenge for reliably detecting gene expression using traditional qPCR methods. RESULTS: We evaluated three novel methodologies along with the traditional qPCR method for their ability to detect Notch pathway gene expression in colorectal cancer FFPE tissue RNAs. We found that quantitative nuclease protection assay-detected gene expression in high-quality RNAs as sensitively as qPCR, and consistently detected mRNAs in highly fragmented FFPE tissue RNAs. CONCLUSION: Quantitative nuclease protection assay represents an improved methodology for detecting gene expression in FFPE tissue and has the potential to advance the development of cancer biomarkers.},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Expression of immune markers is of scientific interest because of their potential roles as predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy. Although the microenvironment of metastatic tumors and/or therapy-inducible histological transformation may affect the expression of these immune markers, there are few data regarding this context. METHODS: A 76-year-old never-smoking female with EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma (AC) acquired resistance to gefitinib. After her death, an autopsy revealed SCLC transformation and EGFR T790M secondary mutation (T790M) as mutually exclusive resistance mechanisms occurring differently in different metastases; two liver metastases (SCLC versus AC with T790M) and two lymph node metastases (SCLC versus AC with T790M) were analyzed to compare the expression status of immune markers by immunohistochemistry and by an immune oncology gene expression panel. RESULTS: Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein was partially expressed in tumor cells with AC lesions (T790M) but not in tumor cells with SCLC transformation. The liver metastasis with SCLC transformation showed no stromal PD-L1 expression and scant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, whereas the other lesions demonstrated stromal PD-L1 staining and infiltration of CD8-positive T cells. Data generated using an immuno-oncology gene expression panel indicated a higher level of T-cell costimulatory molecules and lower expression of type I interferon-regulated genes in lesions with SCLC transformation. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the heterogeneity of expression of immune markers depending on the metastatic sites and histological transformation and indicate that the biopsy specimen from one lesion may not be representative of immune marker status for all lesions.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Most non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are now diagnosed from small specimens, and classification using standard pathology methods can be difficult. This is of clinical relevance as many therapy regimens and clinical trials are histology dependent. The purpose of this study was to develop an mRNA expression signature as an adjunct test for routine histopathologic classification of NSCLCs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A microarray dataset of resected adenocarcinomas (ADC) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) was used as the learning set for an ADC-SCC signature. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung RNAseq dataset was used for validation. Another microarray dataset of ADCs and matched nonmalignant lung was used as the learning set for a tumor versus nonmalignant signature. The classifiers were selected as the most differentially expressed genes and sample classification was determined by a nearest distance approach. RESULTS: We developed a 62-gene expression signature that contained many genes used in immunostains for NSCLC typing. It includes 42 genes that distinguish ADC from SCC and 20 genes differentiating nonmalignant lung from lung cancer. Testing of the TCGA and other public datasets resulted in high prediction accuracies (93%-95%). In addition, a prediction score was derived that correlates both with histologic grading and prognosis. We developed a practical version of the Classifier using the HTG EdgeSeq nuclease protection-based technology in combination with next-generation sequencing that can be applied to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues and small biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Our RNA classifier provides an objective, quantitative method to aid in the pathologic diagnosis of lung cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 22(19); 4880-9. {\copyright}2016 AACR.},

	Abstract = {AIM: Differences in children's development and susceptibility to diseases and exposures have been observed by sex, yet human studies of sex differences in miRNAs are limited. MATERIALS \& METHODS: The genome-wide miRNA expression was characterized by sequencing-based EdgeSeq assay in cord blood buffy coats from 89 newborns, and 564 miRNAs were further analyzed. RESULTS: Differential expression of most miRNAs was higher in boys. Neurodevelopment, RNA metabolism and metabolic ontology terms were enriched among miRNA targets. The majority of upregulated miRNAs (86{\%}) validated by nCounter maintained positive-fold change values; however, only 21{\%} reached statistical significance by false discovery rate. CONCLUSION: Accounting for host factors like sex may improve the sensitivity of epigenetic analyses for epidemiological studies in early childhood.},

@article{Holik:2017aa,
	Abstract = {Carefully designed control experiments provide a gold standard for benchmarking different genomics research tools. A shortcoming of many gene expression control studies is that replication involves profiling the same reference RNA sample multiple times. This leads to low, pure technical noise that is atypical of regular studies. To achieve a more realistic noise structure, we generated a RNA-sequencing mixture experiment using two cell lines of the same cancer type. Variability was added by extracting RNA from independent cell cultures and degrading particular samples. The systematic gene expression changes induced by this design allowed benchmarking of different library preparation kits (standard poly-A versus total RNA with Ribozero depletion) and analysis pipelines. Data generated using the total RNA kit had more signal for introns and various RNA classes (ncRNA, snRNA, snoRNA) and less variability after degradation. For differential expression analysis, voom with quality weights marginally outperformed other popular methods, while for differential splicing, DEXSeq was simultaneously the most sensitive and the most inconsistent method. For sample deconvolution analysis, DeMix outperformed IsoPure convincingly. Our RNA-sequencing data set provides a valuable resource for benchmarking different protocols and data pre-processing workflows. The extra noise mimics routine lab experiments more closely, ensuring any conclusions are widely applicable.},

	Abstract = {We have assessed the utility of RNA titration samples for evaluating microarray platform performance and the impact of different normalization methods on the results obtained. As part of the MicroArray Quality Control project, we investigated the performance of five commercial microarray platforms using two independent RNA samples and two titration mixtures of these samples. Focusing on 12,091 genes common across all platforms, we determined the ability of each platform to detect the correct titration response across the samples. Global deviations from the response predicted by the titration ratios were observed. These differences could be explained by variations in relative amounts of messenger RNA as a fraction of total RNA between the two independent samples. Overall, both the qualitative and quantitative correspondence across platforms was high. In summary, titration samples may be regarded as a valuable tool, not only for assessing microarray platform performance and different analysis methods, but also for determining some underlying biological features of the samples.},

	Abstract = {Given the increasing interest in their use as disease biomarkers, the establishment of reproducible, accurate, sensitive, and specific platforms for microRNA (miRNA) quantification in biofluids is of high priority. We compare four platforms for these characteristics: small RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), FirePlex, EdgeSeq, and nCounter. For a pool of synthetic miRNAs, coefficients of variation for technical replicates are lower for EdgeSeq (6.9%) and RNA-seq (8.2%) than for FirePlex (22.4%); nCounter replicates are not performed. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for distinguishing present versus absent miRNAs shows small RNA-seq (area under curve 0.99) is superior to EdgeSeq (0.97), nCounter (0.94), and FirePlex (0.81). Expected differences in expression of placenta-associated miRNAs in plasma from pregnant and non-pregnant women are observed with RNA-seq and EdgeSeq, but not FirePlex or nCounter. These results indicate that differences in performance among miRNA profiling platforms impact ability to detect biological differences among samples and thus their relative utility for research and clinical use.},

@article{Ran:2020aa,
	Abstract = {3566Background: Clinical biomarker studies are often hindered by the availability of tissue specimens of sufficient quality and quantity. While RNA-Seq is often considered the gold standard for measuring mRNA expression levels in cancer tissue, it typically requires multiple formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections to extract a sufficient amount of quality RNA for subsequent gene expression profiling analysis. The HTG EdgeSeq technology is a gene expression profiling platform that combines quantitative nuclease protection assay technology with next-generation sequencing detection. Unlike RNA-Seq, the HTG EdgeSeq technology does not require RNA extraction, and can use small amounts of tissue material, typically several mm2, to generate reproducible gene expression profiles. Methods: This study compares the performance of RNA-Seq and HTG's profiling panel, the HTG EdgeSeq Precision Immuno-Oncology Panel (PIP), which is designed to measure expression levels of 1,392 genes focused on tumor/immune interaction. Approximately 1,200 samples from three tumor indications (gastric cancer, colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer) were tested using both technologies. Results: Up to four FFPE slides were used for RNA extraction to support RNA-Seq testing; out of the 1,202 samples processed, 1,099 generated extracted RNA of sufficient quality and quantity (as measured by RNA concentration, RIN score and {\%}DV200) to proceed to sequencing, which resulted in a pass rate of 91.4{\%} for RNA-Seq. The HTG EdgeSeq PIP panel resulted in a pass rate of 97.3{\%} (samples passing QC metrics) when the same 1,200 samples were tested, and required only a single FFPE section owing to the small sample requirement. The t-SNE (a non-linear dimensionality reduction method) analysis of the common 1,358 genes revealed similar clustering of the three cancer indications between the two methods. Correlations across individual genes by sample resulted in the mean Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.73 (95{\%} confidence interval of 0.61 - 0.80). Additionally, gene-wise comparisons across all samples were also evaluated. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that HTG EdgeSeq gene expression panels can be used as a competitive alternative to RNA-Seq, generating equivalent gene expression results, while offering the added benefits of a small sample size requirement, lack of RNA extraction bias, and fully automated data analysis pipeline.},

While RNA-Seq is often considered the gold standard for measuring mRNA expression levels in cancer tissue, it typically requires multiple formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections to extract a sufficient amount of quality RNA for subsequent gene expression profiling analysis. The HTG EdgeSeq technology is a gene expression profiling platform that combines quantitative nuclease protection assay technology with next-generation sequencing detection. Unlike RNA-Seq, the HTG EdgeSeq technology does not require RNA extraction, and can use small amounts of tissue material, typically several mm2, to generate reproducible gene expression profiles. Methods: This study compares the performance of RNA-Seq and HTG's profiling panel, the HTG EdgeSeq Precision Immuno-Oncology Panel (PIP), which is designed to measure expression levels of 1,392 genes focused on tumor/immune interaction. Approximately 1,200 samples from three tumor indications (gastric cancer, colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer) were tested using both technologies. Results: Up to four FFPE slides were used for RNA extraction to support RNA-Seq testing; out of the 1,202 samples processed, 1,099 generated extracted RNA of sufficient quality and quantity (as measured by RNA concentration, RIN score and {\%}DV200) to proceed to sequencing, which resulted in a pass rate of 91.4{\%} for RNA-Seq.

	Abstract = {This study examined the role of the ubiquitin E3-ligase RNF123 in modulating downstream NF-κB1 targets in glioblastoma (GB) tumor progression. Our findings revealed an oncogenic pathway (miR-155-5p-RNF123-NF-κB1-p50-SerpinE1) that may represent a new therapeutic target pathway for GB patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH) WT (wild type). Mechanistically, we demonstrated that RNF123 is downregulated in IDH WT GB patients and leads to the reduction of p50 levels. RNA-sequencing, reverse-phase protein arrays, and in vitro functional assays on IDH WT GB cell lines with RNF123 overexpression showed that SerpinE1 was a downstream target that is negatively regulated by RNF123. SERPINE1 knockdown reduced the proliferation and invasion of IDH WT GB cell lines. Both SerpinE1 and miR-155-5p overexpression negatively modulated RNF123 expression. In clinical translational analysis, RNF123, SerpinE1, and miR-155-5p were all associated with poor outcomes in GB patients. Multivariable analysis in IDH WT GB patients showed that concurrent low RNF123 and high SerpinE1 was an independent prognostic factor in predicting poor overall survival (p < 0.001, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-5.05), and an increased risk of recurrence (p < 0.001, relative risk (RR) = 3.56, 95% CI 1.61-7.83).},
