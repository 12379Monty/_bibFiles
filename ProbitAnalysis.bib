	abstract = {Dose-response analysis can be carried out using multi-purpose commercial statistical software, but except for a few special cases the analysis easily becomes cumbersome as relevant, non-standard output requires manual programming. The extension package drc for the statistical environment R provides a flexible and versatile infrastructure for dose-response analyses in general. The present version of the package, reflecting extensions and modifications over the last decade, provides a user-friendly interface to specify the model assumptions about the dose-response relationship and comes with a number of extractors for summarizing fitted models and carrying out inference on derived parameters. The aim of the present paper is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art dose-response analysis, both in terms of general concepts that have evolved and matured over the years and by means of concrete examples.},

	abstract = {Dose-response relationships reflect the effects of a substance on organisms, and are widely used in broad research areas, from medicine and physiology, to vector control and pest management in agronomy. Furthermore, reporting on the response of organisms to stressors is an essential component of many public policies (e.g. public health, environment), and assessment of xenobiotic responses is an integral part of World Health Organization recommendations. Building upon an R script that we previously made available, and considering its popularity, we have now developed a software package in the R environment, BioRssay, to efficiently analyze dose-response relationships. It has more user-friendly functions and more flexibility, and proposes an easy interpretation of the results. The functions in the BioRssay package are built on robust statistical analyses to compare the dose/exposure-response of various bioassays and effectively visualize them in probit-graphs.},

	abstract = {Algorithmic techniques for computing optimal designs continue being a need in the optimal experimental design field. The increasing interest in finding the optimal experimental conditions makes that new methods are demanded for more complex frameworks showing more realistic situations. Numerical techniques are often the unique viable option for computing these designs since to tackle analytically the problem results impracticable in most of cases. Wynn--Fedorov algorithm, multiplicative algorithm and their modifications are the more frequently used methods in the literature for computing D-optimal designs. However, they are not always suitable and efficient to compute optimal designs since their procedures are very limited by the computational requirements. A new algorithm to obtain D-optimal designs is proposed in this paper. It is based on combining suitable strategies followed by the traditional algorithms. A proof of the convergence is provided and several numerical examples are presented to illustrate its improved results.},

We show that for a large group of optimality criteria which includes the main ones in the literature (e.g. A-, D-, E-, F- and G-optimality) the optimal design for our class of models is a two-point design with support points symmetrically placed about the ED50 but with possibly unequal weighting. We demonstrate how one can further reduce the problem to a one-variable optimization by characterizing various of the common criteria. We also use the results to demonstrate major qualitative differences between the F - and c-optimal designs, two design criteria which have similar motivation.},

@article{Wu:2014aa,
	abstract = {In sensitivity testing the test specimens are subjected to a variety of stress levels to generate response or nonresponse. These data are used to estimate the critical stimulus (or threshold) level of the experimental object. Because of its versatile applications, several sensitivity testing procedures have been proposed and used in practice. There remains the outstanding question of finding an efficient procedure, especially when the sample size is small and the interest lies in the extreme percentiles. In the paper we propose a novel three-phase procedure, dubbed 3pod, which can be described as a trilogy of ``search-estimate-approximate''. A core novel idea is to choose the stress levels to quickly achieve an overlapping data pattern which ensures the estimability of the underlying parameters. Simulation comparisons show that 3pod outperforms existing procedures over a range of scenarios in terms of efficiency and robustness.},

@article{Holland-Letz:2015aa,
	abstract = {In most areas of clinical and preclinical research, the required sample size determines the costs and effort for any project, and thus, optimizing sample size is of primary importance. An experimental design of dose-response studies is determined by the number and choice of dose levels as well as the allocation of sample size to each level. The experimental design of toxicological studies tends to be motivated by convention. Statistical optimal design theory, however, allows the setting of experimental conditions (dose levels, measurement times, etc.) in a way which minimizes the number of required measurements and subjects to obtain the desired precision of the results. While the general theory is well established, the mathematical complexity of the problem so far prevents widespread use of these techniques in practical studies. The paper explains the concepts of statistical optimal design theory with a minimum of mathematical terminology and uses these concepts to generate concrete usable D-optimal experimental designs for dose-response studies on the basis of three common dose-response functions in toxicology: log-logistic, log-normal and Weibull functions with four parameters each. The resulting designs usually require control plus only three dose levels and are quite intuitively plausible. The optimal designs are compared to traditional designs such as the typical setup of cytotoxicity studies for 96-well plates. As the optimal design depends on prior estimates of the dose-response function parameters, it is shown what loss of efficiency occurs if the parameters for design determination are misspecified, and how Bayes optimal designs can improve the situation.},
