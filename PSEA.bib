@article{Taguchi:2007aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some but not all patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) respond to treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We developed and tested the ability of a predictive algorithm based on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of pretreatment serum to identify patients who are likely to benefit from treatment with EGFR TKIs. METHODS: Serum collected from NSCLC patients before treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib were analyzed by MALDI MS. Spectra were acquired independently at two institutions. An algorithm to predict outcomes after treatment with EGFR TKIs was developed from a training set of 139 patients from three cohorts. The algorithm was then tested in two independent validation cohorts of 67 and 96 patients who were treated with gefitinib and erlotinib, respectively, and in three control cohorts of patients who were not treated with EGFR TKIs. The clinical outcomes of survival and time to progression were analyzed. RESULTS: An algorithm based on eight distinct m/z features was developed based on outcomes after EGFR TKI therapy in training set patients. Classifications based on spectra acquired at the two institutions had a concordance of 97.1%. For both validation cohorts, the classifier identified patients who showed improved outcomes after EGFR TKI treatment. In one cohort, median survival of patients in the predicted "good" and "poor" groups was 207 and 92 days, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] of death in the good versus poor groups = 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24 to 0.78). In the other cohort, median survivals were 306 versus 107 days (HR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.17 to 0.63). The classifier did not predict outcomes in patients who did not receive EGFR TKI treatment. CONCLUSION: This MALDI MS algorithm was not merely prognostic but could classify NSCLC patients for good or poor outcomes after treatment with EGFR TKIs. This algorithm may thus assist in the pretreatment selection of appropriate subgroups of NSCLC patients for treatment with EGFR TKIs.},

@article{Weber:2018aa,
	abstract = {A mass spectrometry analysis was performed using serum from patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors to define baseline protein signatures associated with outcome in metastatic melanoma. Pretreatment serum was obtained from a development set of 119 melanoma patients on a trial of nivolumab with or without a multipeptide vaccine and from patients receiving pembrolizumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab, or both nivolumab and ipilimumab. Spectra were obtained using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. These data combined with clinical data identified patients with better or worse outcomes. The test was applied to five independent patient cohorts treated with checkpoint inhibitors and its biology investigated using enrichment analyses. A signature consisting of 209 proteins or peptides was associated with progression-free and overall survival in a multivariate analysis. The test performance across validation cohorts was consistent with the development set results. A pooled analysis, stratified by set, demonstrated a significantly better overall survival for "sensitive" relative to "resistant" patients, HR = 0.15 (95% confidence interval: 0.06-0.40, P < 0.001). The test was also associated with survival in a cohort of ipilimumab-treated patients. Test classification was found to be associated with acute phase reactant, complement, and wound healing pathways. We conclude that a pretreatment signature of proteins, defined by mass spectrometry analysis and machine learning, predicted survival in patients receiving PD-1 blocking antibodies. This signature of proteins was associated with acute phase reactants and elements of wound healing and the complement cascade. This signature merits further study to determine if it identifies patients who would benefit from PD-1 blockade. Cancer Immunol Res; 6(1); 79-86. {\copyright}2017 AACR.},

@article{Anderson:2004aa,
	abstract = {We have merged four different views of the human plasma proteome, based on different methodologies, into a single nonredundant list of 1175 distinct gene products. The methodologies used were 1) literature search for proteins reported to occur in plasma or serum; 2) multidimensional chromatography of proteins followed by two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy (MS) identification of resolved proteins; 3) tryptic digestion and multidimensional chromatography of peptides followed by MS identification; and 4) tryptic digestion and multidimensional chromatography of peptides from low-molecular-mass plasma components followed by MS identification. Of 1,175 nonredundant gene products, 195 were included in more than one of the four input datasets. Only 46 appeared in all four. Predictions of signal sequence and transmembrane domain occurrence, as well as Genome Ontology annotation assignments, allowed characterization of the nonredundant list and comparison of the data sources. The "nonproteomic" literature (468 input proteins) is strongly biased toward signal sequence-containing extracellular proteins, while the three proteomics methods showed a much higher representation of cellular proteins, including nuclear, cytoplasmic, and kinesin complex proteins. Cytokines and protein hormones were almost completely absent from the proteomics data (presumably due to low abundance), while categories like DNA-binding proteins were almost entirely absent from the literature data (perhaps unexpected and therefore not sought). Most major categories of proteins in the human proteome are represented in plasma, with the distribution at successively deeper layers shifting from mostly extracellular to a distribution more like the whole (primarily cellular) proteome. The resulting nonredundant list confirms the presence of a number of interesting candidate marker proteins in plasma and serum.},

@article{Irizarry:2009aa,
	abstract = {Among the many applications of microarray technology, one of the most popular is the identification of genes that are differentially expressed in two conditions. A common statistical approach is to quantify the interest of each gene with a p-value, adjust these p-values for multiple comparisons, choose an appropriate cut-off, and create a list of candidate genes. This approach has been criticised for ignoring biological knowledge regarding how genes work together. Recently a series of methods, that do incorporate biological knowledge, have been proposed. However, the most popular method, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), seems overly complicated. Furthermore, GSEA is based on a statistical test known for its lack of sensitivity. In this article we compare the performance of a simple alternative to GSEA. We find that this simple solution clearly outperforms GSEA. We demonstrate this with eight different microarray datasets.},

	abstract = {The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) is one of the most widely used and comprehensive databases of gene sets for performing gene set enrichment analysis. Since its creation, MSigDB has grown beyond its roots in metabolic disease and cancer to include >10,000 gene sets. These better represent a wider range of biological processes and diseases, but the utility of the database is reduced by increased redundancy across, and heterogeneity within, gene sets. To address this challenge, here we use a combination of automated approaches and expert curation to develop a collection of "hallmark" gene sets as part of MSigDB. Each hallmark in this collection consists of a "refined" gene set, derived from multiple "founder" sets, that conveys a specific biological state or process and displays coherent expression. The hallmarks effectively summarize most of the relevant information of the original founder sets and, by reducing both variation and redundancy, provide more refined and concise inputs for gene set enrichment analysis.},

@article{Grigorieva:2020aa,
	abstract = {Mass spectral data from multiple samples are suitable for a hypothesis-free development of clinically useful multivariate tests using modern machine learning techniques. However, the transition from discovery to adoption of proteomic tests has proved challenging. Slow adoption of these tests in clinical practice is, in part, related to insufficient understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying multivariate tests developed based on correlative studies. While identification of individual proteins may provide important insights, elucidation of concerted relationships of sets of proteins with biological pathways can better reflect complex phenomena, such as cancerogenesis and response to treatment. Protein set enrichment analysis (PSEA) allows identification of associations of mass spectral features or test classifications with biological function by looking for consistent correlations across a group of proteins. We evaluated the utility of PSEA for exploring the biological information content of mass spectra, using a sample set with mass spectral data and matched protein expression information. This made it possible to detect significant biological associations with mass spectral peaks without identifying their protein constituents. We demonstrated that the method produces reproducible associations and can be used for elucidation of the mechanisms of action associated with two previously developed multivariate mass spectrometry-based tests. Significant correlations with several host immune response-related processes were found on the level of individual mass spectral features and with test classifications. The results illustrate the utility of the PSEA approach applied to mass spectral data as a method for elucidating biological mechanisms underlying phenotypes related to different physiological states of the organism.},

	abstract = {PSEA-Quant analyzes quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics datasets to identify enrichments of annotations contained in repositories such as the Gene Ontology and Molecular Signature databases. It allows users to identify the annotations that are significantly enriched for reproducibly quantified high abundance proteins. PSEA-Quant is available on the Web and as a command-line tool. It is compatible with all label-free and isotopic labeling-based quantitative proteomics methods. This protocol describes how to use PSEA-Quant and interpret its output. The importance of each parameter as well as troubleshooting approaches are also discussed. {\copyright}2016 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

@article{Roder:2019aa,
	abstract = {Set enrichment methods are commonly used to analyze high-dimensional molecular data and gain biological insight into molecular or clinical phenotypes. One important category of analysis methods employs an enrichment score, which is created from ranked univariate correlations between phenotype and each molecular attribute. Estimates of the significance of the associations are determined via a null distribution generated from phenotype permutation. We investigate some statistical properties of this method and demonstrate how alternative assessments of enrichment can be used to increase the statistical power of such analyses to detect associations between phenotype and biological processes and pathways.},
