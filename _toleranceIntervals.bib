@article{Rebafka:2007aa,
	abstract = {Recently a new validation procedure was developed using a graphical statistical tool --the so-called accuracy profile --that makes interpretation of results easy and straightforward. Accuracy profiles are estimated by tolerance intervals. Most existing methods for constructing tolerance limits are confined to the restrictive case of normally distributed data. The present study is focused on a nonparametric approach based on bootstrap ---in order to get out of this constraint. The Mathematical section recalls some definitions and presents the derivation of the new nonparametric bootstrap approach for setting two-sided mean coverage and guaranteed coverage tolerance limits for a balanced one-way random effects model. The section concludes with a simulation study assessing the performance of the bootstrap methods in comparison to classical methods. Finally, the applicability of the proposed intervals is demonstrated by application to the problem of quantitative analytical method validation based on the accuracy profile. This approach is illustrated by an example consisting in the HPLC determination of the vitamers of vitamin B3 (nicotinamide and nicotinic acid) in milk. The efficiency of the new tolerance intervals is demonstrated as well as the applicability of accuracy profiles in the delicate situation where a correction factor must be applied because there is not a full recovery of the analyte. The comparison of the various tolerance intervals also gives some indication on their interpretation.},

@article{Cho:2021aa,
	abstract = {A tolerance interval is a statistical interval that covers at least 100ρ{\%} of the population of interest with a 100(1−α){\%} confidence, where ρand αare pre-specified values in (0, 1). In many scientific fields, such as pharmaceutical sciences, manufacturing processes, clinical sciences, and environmental sciences, tolerance intervals are used for statistical inference and quality control. Despite the usefulness of tolerance intervals, the procedures to compute tolerance intervals are not commonly implemented in statistical software packages. This paper aims to provide a comparative study of the computational procedures for tolerance intervals in some commonly used statistical software packages including JMP, Minitab, NCSS, Python, R, and SAS. On the other hand, we also investigate the effect of misspecifying the underlying probability model on the performance of tolerance intervals. We study the performance of tolerance intervals when the assumed distribution is the same as the true underlying distribution and when the assumed distribution is different from the true distribution via a Monte Carlo simulation study. We also propose a robust model selection approach to obtain tolerance intervals that are relatively insensitive to the model misspecification. We show that the proposed robust model selection approach performs well when the underlying distribution is unknown but candidate distributions are available.},

@article{Hoffman:2005aa,
	abstract = {A procedure for constructing two-sided beta-content, gamma-confidence tolerance intervals is proposed for general random effects models, in both balanced and unbalanced data scenarios. The proposed intervals are based on the concept of effective sample size and modified large sample methods for constructing confidence bounds on functions of variance components. The performance of the proposed intervals is evaluated via simulation techniques. The results indicate that the proposed intervals generally maintain the nominal confidence and content levels. Application of the proposed procedure is illustrated with a one-fold nested design used to evaluate the performance of a quantitative bioanalytical method.},

@article{Francq:2019aa,
	abstract = {The literature about Prediction Interval (PI) and Tolerance Interval (TI) in linear mixed models is usually developed for specific designs, which is a main limitation to their use. This paper proposes to reformulate the two-sided PI to be generalizable under a wide variety of designs (one random factor, nested and crossed designs for multiple random factors, and balanced or unbalanced designs). This new methodology is based on the Hessian matrix, namely, the inverse of (observed) Fisher Information matrix, and is built with a cell mean model. The degrees of freedom for the total variance are calculated with the generalized Satterthwaite method and compared to the Kenward-Roger's degrees of freedom for fixed effects. Construction of two-sided TIs are also detailed with one random factor, and two nested and two crossed random variables. An extensive simulation study is carried out to compare the widths and coverage probabilities of Confidence Intervals (CI), PIs, and TIs to their nominal levels. It shows excellent coverage whatever the design and the sample size are. Finally, these CIs, PIs, and TIs are applied to two real data sets: one from orthopedic surgery study (intralesional resection risk) and the other from assay validation study during vaccine development.},

@article{Aert:2021aa,
	abstract = {The pooled estimate of the average effect is of primary interest when fitting the random-effects model for meta-analysis. However estimates of study specific effects, for example those displayed on forest plots, are also often of interest. In this tutorial, we present the case, with the accompanying statistical theory, for estimating the study specific true effects using so called 'empirical Bayes estimates' or 'Best Unbiased Linear Predictions' under the random-effects model. These estimates can be accompanied by prediction intervals that indicate a plausible range of study specific true effects. We coalesce and elucidate the available literature and illustrate the methodology using two published meta-analyses as examples. We also perform a simulation study that reveals that coverage probability of study specific prediction intervals are substantially too low if the between-study variance is small but not negligible. Researchers need to be aware of this defect when interpreting prediction intervals. We also show how empirical Bayes estimates, accompanied with study specific prediction intervals, can embellish forest plots. We hope that this tutorial will serve to provide a clear theoretical underpinning for this methodology and encourage its widespread adoption.},
