	abstract = {Enrichment capture methods for NGS are widely used, however, they evolve rapidly and it is necessary to periodically measure their strengths and weaknesses before transfer to diagnostic services. We assessed two recently released custom DNA solution-capture enrichment methods for NGS, namely Illumina NRCCE and Agilent SureSelectQXT, against a reference method NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Choice on a similar gene panel, sharing 678 kb and 110 genes. Two Illumina MiSeq runs of 12 samples each have been performed, for each of the three methods, using the same 24 patients (affected with sensorineural disorders). Technical outcomes have been computed and compared, including depth and evenness of coverage, enrichment in targeted regions, performance in GC-rich regions and ability to generate consistent variant datasets. While we show that the three methods resulted in suitable datasets for standard DNA variant discovery, we describe significant differences between the results for the above parameters. NimbleGen offered the best depth of coverage and evenness, while NRCCE showed the highest on target levels but high duplicate rates. SureSelectQXT showed an overall quality close to that of NimbleGen. The new methods exhibit reduced preparation time but behave differently. These findings will guide laboratories in their choice of library enrichment approach.},

@article{Bates:2015aa,
	abstract = {Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

@article{Brittain:2012aa,
	abstract = {A noninferiority (NI) trial is sometimes employed to show efficacy of a new treatment when it is unethical to randomize current patients to placebo because of the established efficacy of a standard treatment. Under this framework, if the NI trial determines that the treatment advantage of the standard to the new drug (i.e. S-N) is less than the historic advantage of the standard to placebo (S-P), then the efficacy of the new treatment (N-P) is established indirectly. We explicitly combine information from the NI trial with estimates from a random effects model, allowing study-to-study variability in k historic trials. Existing methods under random effects, such as the synthesis method, fail to account for the variability of the true standard versus placebo effect in the NI trial. Our method effectively uses a prediction interval for the missing standard versus placebo effect rather than a confidence interval of the mean. The consequences are to increase the variance of the synthesis method by incorporating a prediction variance term and to approximate the null distribution of the new statistic with a t with k-1 degrees of freedom instead of the standard normal. Thus, it is harder to conclude NI of the new to (predicted) placebo, compared with traditional methods, especially when k is small or when between study variability is large. When the between study variances are nonzero, we demonstrate substantial Type I error rate inflation with conventional approaches; simulations suggest that the new procedure has only modest inflation, and it is very conservative when between study variances are zero. An example is used to illustrate practical issues.},

@article{Mascha:2011aa,
	abstract = {Equivalence and noninferiority designs are useful when the superiority of one intervention over another is neither expected nor required. Equivalence trials test whether a difference between groups falls within a prespecified equivalence region, whereas noninferiority trials test whether a preferred intervention is either better or at least not worse than the comparator, with worse being defined a priori. Special designs and analyses are needed because neither of these conclusions can be reached from a nonsignificant test for superiority. Using the data from a companion article, we demonstrate analyses of basic equivalence and noninferiority designs, along with more complex model-based methods. We first give an overview of methods for design and analysis of data from superiority, equivalence, and noninferiority trials, including how to analyze each type of design using linear regression models. We then show how the analogous hypotheses can be tested in a repeated-measures setting in which there are multiple outcomes per subject. We especially address interactions between the repeated factor, usually time, and treatment. Although we focus on the analysis of continuous outcomes, extensions to other data types as well as sample size consideration are discussed.},

@article{Diao:2017aa,
	abstract = {Noninferiority multiregional clinical trials (MRCTs) have recently received increasing attention in drug development. While a major goal in an MRCT is to estimate the global treatment effect, it is also important to assess the consistency of treatment effects across multiple regions. In this paper, we propose an intuitive definition of consistency of noninferior treatment effects across regions under the random-effects modeling framework. Specifically, we quantify the consistency of treatment effects by the percentage of regions that meet a predefined treatment margin. This new approach enables us to achieve both goals in one modeling framework. We propose to use a signed likelihood ratio test for testing the global treatment effect and the consistency of noninferior treatment effects. In addition, we provide guidelines for the allocation rule to achieve optimal power for testing consistency among multiple regions. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed methodology. An application to a real data example is provided.},
